 AFG_Graveyard_of_Empires_desc: "Many know the tales of great empires from Macedon to the British struggling and even collapsing due to the Afghan resistance. Even since before states existed within this region, the indigenous Afghans have been a formidable foe against any aggressor. This notion still holds today, any foreign adversary will want to fear the mountains on which they tread."
