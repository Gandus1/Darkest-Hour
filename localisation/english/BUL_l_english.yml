 BUL_Politics.1.t: "Bulgaria wants to purchase some of our Light Tanks"
 BUL_Politics.1.d: ""
 BUL_Politics.1.A: "We have a deal"
 BUL_Politics.1.B: "We can't"
 
 BUL_Politics.2.t: "Bulgaria wants to purchase some of our Light Tanks"
 BUL_Politics.2.d: ""
 BUL_Politics.2.A: "Great"
 #Bulgaria Fighter Stuff. They will look weird.
 BUL_Politics.4.E: "Approach Czechoslovakia"
 BUL_Politics.5.E: "Select Czechoslovakia Planes"

 BUL_Politics.9.t: "The Planning Begins"
 BUL_Politics.9.d: "The government not only has failed to address the concerns of the military, but also the Bulgarian people. Their constant pointless bickering and rampant corruption among their ranks make them unreliable to rule the nation. To no one surprise, the People's Bloc coalition has provoked a crisis by merely existing. After the National Assembly kicked the Minister of Railways, Posts, and Telegraphs, Stoyan Kosturkov, from the cabinet and the Agrarian Union left the government, Prime Minister Nikola Mushanov has resigned in shame. The impudence of this man is unbelievable: after one failure after another, he still pretends to have a saying in forming a new government! As our allies in the armed forces are being purged for expressing their rightful discontent at this charade, it is clear that the time to act has come.\n\nOur group of patriotic officers, the Zveno, is planning to expel the corrupt People’s Bloc from power to bring order to the nation. This difficult task will require collaboration with many people across the political spectrum to have superior numbers against our enemies. However, removing the main threat to Bulgarian stability is our main priority now, which is above any possible ideological difference."
 BUL_Politics.9.A: "Lets see where this leads us"

 BUL_Politics.10.t: "What about the Democrats?"
 BUL_Politics.10.d: "It sounds ridiculous, almost surreal. To defeat the People’s Bloc, we need to recruit people...from the People’s Bloc. Our men have contacted representatives of the People's Social Movement, the Democratic Party, and the Bulgarian Agrarian Union to include them in the government and legitimize our new government after the deed is done. Now that the planning is underway, the Zveno and the Military Union will need enough manpower to break the security forces. The recruitment of these individuals goes against our values but is also necessary to end the tyranny of the People’s Bloc."
 BUL_Politics.10.A: "We have a deal"
 BUL_Politics.10.B: "This is ridiculous. How did I miss this? We’re smarter than this"

 BUL_Politics.11.t: "What about the Fascists?"
 BUL_Politics.11.d: "Our attempts to reach the Democrats and the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union \"Vrabcha 1\" have been mixed. So far, Hristo Kalfov, Ivan Rusev, and Dimitar Gichev have refused to participate, but Petar Todorov has joined our cause. With the preparations for our plan now being in full swing, many of our more radical members have time and time again pushed us to officially call on the help of the Fascist forces in and outside our movement in order to bolster our ranks and ensure our victory. Fascist elements have been rising in popularity over the years. Just last year, two Fascist groups were created: The Union of Bulgarian National Legions by Lyuben Kostov and the National Social Movement by Alexander Tsankov. Even if they lack political influence, the National Social Movement posses large membership, complete with armed and trained paramilitaries who would greatly aid us should the coup become more heated than expected. On the other hand, it very may be that allying with these groups could sour our public image, while also forcing out more liberal-minded forces out of our movement."
 BUL_Politics.11.A: "We have no need for these drunken criminals."
 BUL_Politics.11.B: "We have common goals and common enemies. We will fight side by side."

 BUL_Politics.12.t: "The Planning is completed"
 BUL_Politics.12.d: "After countless hours of planning, studying the weaknesses of our enemies, and making the necessary preparations both the Military Union and Zveno report that everything that can be done for the coup has been completed and can be set in motion at the agreed-upon signal.\n\nThe new government which we seek to install will be headed by Kimon Georgiev with Damyan Velchev, Petar Todorov, Ivan Harizanov, Kosta Boyadjiev, Petar Midilev, Stavri Andreev, Stancho Cholakov, and Mihail Kalendarov taking up the various minister and government positions.\n\nAlthough some members of our movement are still hesitant about the coup, mainly the Monarchists around Pencho Zlatev, the rest is in good spirits and assumes that our takeover will go off without any hiccups."
 BUL_Politics.12.A: "Time to wait for that day in May"

 BUL_Politics.13.t: "The coup d'état begins"
 BUL_Politics.13.d: "The plan is now already in motion. At 10:30 in the evening, our leaders gathered at Vassil Karakulakov 's home on 27, Ivan Vazov Street, where they prepared a government change decree and orders for new appointments to key posts, and move to the police command by midnight. We will some move to establish control over the main garrisons of the country, and triumphantly march on Sofia. However, there is one remaining issue that could compromise our position: the Tsar. To solve this inconvenience, Colonel Georgi Tanovski has met with Tsar Boris III, informing him of the coup. Although we hope for Boris to remain neutral, our intentions to abolish the monarchy will play a role in whether or not he resists. Some of our comrades could feel alienated if we choose to apply “drastic measures” if the Tsar doesn’t comply with our requests."
 BUL_Politics.13.A: "Boris does the unthinkable"
 BUL_Politics.13.B: "The Tsar makes the right decision and stays out of it"

 BUL_Politics.14.t: "The Royal Family is dead!"
 BUL_Politics.14.d: "That foolish Tsar thought that it was a good idea to turn against us. We assured him that it was nothing against him or the monarchy, but he refused to listen. Unexpectedly, Boris III decided to resist our plans and ordered all the loyalists units to resist our advances. This inconvenience wasn’t intended to happen, so he gave us no choice than to carry out the failsafe plan. Boris and the Royal Family were gunned down by our forces, along with any dissenters in the coup. Although this means we accomplished our long-term goal of ending the Monarchy, this caused a myriad of other problems. The Tsar was quite popular with the people, meaning that a considerable part of the population is not going to recognize our authority. Even worse: the monarchists inside our ranks have defected. The death of the Tsar will no doubt cause instability across the nation, complication our plans even further. If the Tsar had done the right thing, this situation wouldn’t have happened. By defending the corrupt administration, the sole blame of his own doom is on him."
 BUL_Politics.14.A: "The end of the Tsar and a new era for Bulgaria"

 BUL_Politics.15.t: "The Neutral Tsar"
 BUL_Politics.15.d: "Boris III has done the reasonable thing and declared his neutrality in the coup. With the Tsar no longer posing a threat the coup has gone off without a hitch. The People’s Bloc has been removed and a new government has formed around Kimon Georgiev."
 BUL_Politics.15.A: "A new dawn has arrived for Bulgaria"

 BUL_Politics.16.t: "National Assembly Dissolved"
 BUL_Politics.16.d: "The National Assembly, a major roadblock in our goals, has been removed. Citing Article 47 of the Turnovo Constitution, where the NA and Cabinet governs by laws signed by the Tsar, we are simply removing the middleman. Although this has angered any and all Democratic elements, they lack the proper forces to oppose this move."
 BUL_Politics.16.A: "Another one bites the dust."

 BUL_Politics.17.t: "Parties and Unions Banned"
 BUL_Politics.17.d: "To curtail the influence of various political groups, Parties, Unions, and their respective press bodies, are banned. Any and all property belonging to these groups have been nationalized and/or removed. Although many democratic elements are fervently pissed off, they lack the necessary strength to oppose this measure."
 BUL_Politics.17.A: "Another one bites the dust."

 BUL_Politics.18.t: "District Reorganization"
 BUL_Politics.18.d: "To further increase our hold on the country the various administrative districts have received an overhaul. Counties and municipalities have been enlarged, and their self-government abolished. Government-appointed officials now have direct control over their territories."
 BUL_Politics.18.A: "Another one bites the dust."

 BUL_Politics.19.t: "Settlement Renaming"
 BUL_Politics.19.d: "A campaign has begun to replace settlement names. Many settlements, particularly in former Ottoman Thrace, have been successfully given proper traditional Bulgarian names."
 BUL_Politics.19.A: "Finally! No more confusion."

 BUL_Politics.20.t: "Directorate of Public Renewal"
 BUL_Politics.20.d: "The Directorate of Public Renewal has been created. Its task is to lay the foundations for a systematic propaganda regime and public-sector organizations. Strict censorship has been introduced and many print publications also banned. This will give the government a powerful tool to combat dissent."
 BUL_Politics.20.A: "Big Brother is watching."

 BUL_Politics.21.t: "New Unions"
 BUL_Politics.21.d: "To prevent unions from becoming a threat again new state unions with a pro-government outlook have been created. An Enlightenment Union, a casino union of education employees, was established. To cover the workers, The Bulgarian Workers' Union was founded which is divided among alliances for different sectors."
 BUL_Politics.21.A: "Pro-Government unions? That’s a first."

 BUL_Politics.22.t: "State Monopolies"
 BUL_Politics.22.d: "In order to increase government revenue and subsidize agriculture, the government has created state monopolies in the grain, alcohol and tobacco trade. Up to 40% of badly serviced debts since the onset of the Great Depression have been canceled, the rest have been deferred, and debt relief measures are limited. Several troubled private banks have been consolidated and resuscitated with state-owned capital, forming the Bulgarian Credit Bank. The two big state-owned banks are also united in the Bulgarian Agricultural and Cooperative Bank."
 BUL_Politics.22.A: "One step closer to Corporatism."

 BUL_Politics.23.t: "Liquidate the IMRO Threat"
 BUL_Politics.23.d: "A massive crackdown on the IMRO has begun. Their Petrich stronghold is to be raided by the Army, and other pockets will suffer from the crackdown. Although their leader, Ivan Mihailov, has called for a peaceful disarmament, we can give the order to brutally put down the group. It would be understandable and no one would complain, given the group’s history of assassinations and terrorism."
 BUL_Politics.23.A: "Accept the peaceful resolution, no need for more bloodshed."
 BUL_Politics.23.B: "Follow and fire at will, leave nothing alive."

 BUL_Politics.24.t: "The Fascist Issue"
 BUL_Politics.24.d: "Ever since their invitation to the coup, the Fascists have been exerting their influence on Zveno. At this point, their influence has grown uncomfortably large and requires some kind of attention. We can attempt to bring them formally into the fold, which benefits everyone. We can pick the less monarchical of the mix and purge the rest, which have mixed reactions. Or we can purge them all and remove the threat entirely. This will anger them all and cause us issues but the threat is gone completely. "
 BUL_Politics.24.A: "Bring them all in, what’s the worst that can happen?"
 BUL_Politics.24.B: "Take the pick of the litter and purge the rest."
 BUL_Politics.24.C: "Purge them all, leave nothing behind."

 BUL_Politics.25.t: "Education Reform"
 BUL_Politics.25.d: "The education system in Bulgaria has received a major overhaul. Stricter teacher qualification criteria have been introduced, dozens of schools have been closed, and more than 2,000 teachers remain unemployed. This will surely improve the quality of education every Bulgarian receives."
 BUL_Politics.25.A: "Does this mean the peasants can read now?"

 BUL_Politics.26.t: "Military Union Split"
 BUL_Politics.26.d: "In the autumn of 1934, two separate wings were formed in the ruling circles and the Military Union - a pro-monarchist one, headed by Pencho Zlatev, and a pro-republican one, led by Damyan Velchev."
 BUL_Politics.26.A: "Concerning"

 BUL_Politics.27.t: "Military Union Schism"
 BUL_Politics.27.d: "Now that the Military Union has split the only logical choice would be replacing Pencho Zlatev with Damyan Velchev. However, the chance of this backfiring is dependent on how much influence we have on the government and Union overall. Kimon Georgiev attempts to remove Zlatev and…"
 BUL_Politics.27.A: "... is successful, the Monarchist Union did not step in"
 BUL_Politics.27.B: "... is unsuccessful, the Monarchist Union steps in"

 BUL_Foreign.1.t: "Open Relations with the Soviet Union"
 BUL_Foreign.1.d: "Diplomacy has been opened with the Soviet Union. This was a goal for the previous Popular Bloc’s government but it has been achieved under Zveno’s guidance. Although the Bulgarian population isn’t exactly Pro-Soviet, they are Pro-Russian and any goodwill diplomacy with the USSR will please the population."
 BUL_Foreign.1.A: "Moscow is once again on the line."

 BUL_Foreign.2.t: "Balkan Pact Negotiations"
 BUL_Foreign.2.d: "Today the government has declared the continuity of the previous government’s foreign policy. This means focusing on good relations with Bulgaria’s neighbors, all signatories of the Balkan Pact. This puts to rest fears from the Pact, whose concerns of an expansionist Bulgaria grew after the government change."
 BUL_Foreign.2.A: "But has Bulgaria given up those claims though?"

 BUL_Foreign.3.t: "Yugoslav Trade Agreement"
 BUL_Foreign.3.d: "Following the recent Balkan Pact Negotiations Yugoslavia has agreed to a trade agreement with Bulgaria. In both countries this is considered a possible stepping stone to integrating the two into a Greater Yugoslavia."
 BUL_Foreign.3.A: "Success!"

 BUL_Foreign.4.t: "Alexander’s Visit to Sofia"
 BUL_Foreign.4.d: "King of the Yugoslavs, Alexander I, arrived today in Sofia for a state visit. A crowd of thousands has amassed to see Alexander, which has worried the Tsar and pleased the King. This great enthusiasm by the Bulgarians could be taken as further evidence for a possible Greater Yugoslavia."
 BUL_Foreign.4.A: "Wonderful"

 BUL_Countercoup.1.t: "The Monarchists Move In"
 BUL_Countercoup.1.d: "The Pro-Monarchist Central Unit of the Military Alliance has been examining the government’s performance and declared many cabinet positions will be replaced with personal from the Union. It seems the current government has not performed to their standards and requires a shakedown. Kimon Georgiev has lost all influence in the government and is rumored to resign soon."
 BUL_Countercoup.1.A: "They blew it!"

 BUL_Countercoup.2.t: "The Tsar’s Government"
 BUL_Countercoup.2.d: "Kimon Georgiev has announced his resignation and with it the end of his government. A new one has swiftly been appointed lead by Pencho Zlatev. It appears this cabinet is extremely loyal to Tsar Boris and no one else."
 BUL_Countercoup.2.A: "In the name of the Tsar!"

 BUL_Countercoup.3.t: "Fascist Counter-Coup"
 BUL_Countercoup.3.d: "Zveno has split. The Military Union’s leadership has decided that the government has not performed to their standards. The Union has called for the resignation of various cabinet members and in a shocking spectacle, the Fascist elements have seized these positions. Many of these members were supposedly integrated into Zveno’s ranks not too long ago."
 BUL_Countercoup.3.A: "Hooray?"

 BUL_Countercoup.4.t: "Fascists in Control"
 BUL_Countercoup.4.d: "The Fascists have taken over the government. Kimon Georgiev has announced his resignation and a new government lead by Lyuben Kostov. Other prominent members such as Hristo Lukov and Alexander Tsankov have been invited into the government."
 BUL_Countercoup.4.A: "And what’ll happen to the Tsar?"

 BUL_Countercoup.5.t: "The Military Union in Check"
 BUL_Countercoup.5.d: "The Military Union has been curtailed. With the successful removal of Pro-Monarchist elements, the MU can no longer threaten the Zveno government. Despite this development, Boris has demanded the Zveno government step down. Obviously refusing the order, Boris has begun rallying people to his cause hoping to gain enough support to overthrow the Zveno."
 BUL_Countercoup.5.A: "Is he out of his mind?"

 BUL_Countercoup.6.t: "The Counter-Coup Fails"
 BUL_Countercoup.6.d: "Last night the Tsar attempted a Counter-Coup. Despite the sizable forces gathered for this operation, Zveno and its Military allies held off. Boris has been forced to abdicate and the Tsardom abolished. Now, we can begin the final goal, a Greater Yugoslavia."

 BUL_Tzar.2.A: "Wonderful"

 BUL_Tzar.3.t: "Daiman Velchev’s Arrest"
 BUL_Tzar.3.d: "Daiman Velchev has been caught trying to cross the Yugoslav-Bulgarian border today. Apparently Velchev and Military Union elements have been planning a coup to remove Boris and restore their rule in Bulgaria, planning to instantly join Yugoslavia after they secure their power. However, this plan was revealed to the authorities and appropriate measures were taken. The Military Union’s fate is all but certain after this event."
 BUL_Tzar.3.A: "Good riddance"

 BUL_Tzar.4.t: "Liquidation of the Military Union"
 BUL_Tzar.4.d: "The experience of a group of officers in late 1935 trying to carry out an anti-monarchist coup only eased the ruler's task. Velchev was sentenced to death (later his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment), and another purge was carried out in the army. By an official order of the Minister of War, the defeat of the Military Union was announced and the officers were forbidden to engage in political activity"

 BUL_Tzar.5.t: "Elections for the National Assembly"

The country's democratization is also expected to affect the government's international prestige. It begins preparations for elections for local governments and for the National Assembly. No repressive measures have been taken against the opposition, which, despite the ban on the activities of political parties, forms the so-called \"Five\".

 BUL_Tzar.5.A: "A return of democracy."

 BUL_Tzar.6.t: "The Coming Storm"
 BUL_Tzar.6.d: "It is becoming obvious to the Tsar that another war in Europe is inevitable and that he must act to ensure the future for Bulgaria. We can either align with the French or the Germans, as Germans already have a considerable amount of influence through trade, they are a more logical choice. On the other hand we can try and extend our hand to our former enemies, as France has until recently been our biggest trading partner. Whoever we chose will help us modernize our army."
 BUL_Tzar.6.A: "We will side with the Germans, for a New Order in Europe!"
 BUL_Tzar.6.B: "We will side with the Allies, to prevent another National Catastrophe"

 BUL_Tzar.7.t: "The Second Kyoseivanov Government"

 BUL_Tzar.8.A: "The people show their support"

 BUL_Tzar.9.t: "Parliamentary Elections"
 BUL_Tzar.9.d: "Restrictions of the election law, as well as a ban on legal political activity, gave the cabinet the opportunity to bring 93 of its representatives to the National Assembly. Opposition gained 67 deputies (six of them communists, who were later expelled for unfair propaganda in their favor on Radio Moscow). The main forces of the opposition united even before the elections in the so-called Constitutional Bloc."

 BUL_Tzar.11.A: "Good riddance"

 BUL_Tzar.12.t: "1939 Parliamentary Elections"
 BUL_Tzar.12.d: "The rapidly changing international and domestic political situation forced Tsar Boris III to dissolve the National Assembly and remove partisan ministers from the People's Social Movement. The elections for the XXV Ordinary National Assembly were held in December 1939 and ensured a complete victory for the followers of Tsar’s policy. The turnout was 67.2% or 2,175,163 people.

But many independent as well as governmental financial experts believe that growth while not necessarily stagnating, is failing to meet its full potential rate, dearth of funds in the governmental treasury mires governmental investment in ventures that can potentially develop the National Economy. The Government after consultations with its suitable departments has decided to create state corporations that would be granted with a monopoly over the grain, alcohol and tobacco business in the country, it is widely believed that this action would enable the government in raising government revenues and the state treasury’s capital reserves."
 BUL_Bulgarian_Credit_Bank: "Bulgarian Credit Bank"
 BUL_Bulgarian_Credit_Bank_desc: "Bulgarian banking sector is characterized by relatively small size, small number of banks with wide business focus, high degree of concentration and high share of foreign capital. While the sector as a whole is not necessarily in a crisis, many of the smaller banks are facing great difficulties whether it is a lack of branches that is preventing a wider outreach to the customer base, or deficits in capital reserves. The government in order to better oil the banking sector of the Bulgarian economy has decided to merge several of the smaller banks and to consolidate them into a larger entity- The Bulgarian Credit Bank. It is widely believed that with the necessary capital assistance from the state, many of the struggling smaller banks and their services can be revived, preventing any unseen future difficulty in the banking sector."

 BUL_Improve_Relations_with_Yugoslavia: "Improve Relations with Yugoslavia"
 BUL_Improve_Relations_with_Yugoslavia_desc: "Europe is heading in an uncertain direction, and the unlikelihood of war breaking out becoming ever so slightly likely every day, in all cases only our neighbours are the true friends that will stand beside us when Europe catches fire. Yugoslavia, once the epicentre of the “Powderkeg”, now represents the ideal goal of a united Slav nation in the Balkans which many in our administration dream of, in the recent years it has also become reasonably prosperous and a stabilizing factor in the Balkans, and with many in the Zveno having favourable opinions of Yugoslavia and its close proximity to our nation, it is in our interests to use our diplomatic channels to begin strengthening the relationships between the 2 countries."
 BUL_Consolidate_Banking_Sector: "Consolidate the Banking Sector"
 BUL_Consolidate_Banking_Sector_desc: "The Bulgarian banking sector isn't exactly the best in the world, facing the most common issue which every economic institution faces, a simple lack of money, both due to limited revenues as well as prohibitive resources and funds from the government. To better utilize our limited resources, centralization of the banking sector must be done. It can be primarily achieved by consolidating our top 2 state owned banks, one which caters to agricultural industrialists and farmers and the other which caters to the various cooperatives functioning throughout the country. The merger will result in the foundation of the Bulgarian Agricultural and Cooperative Bank, which will boast enhanced facilities, along with the benefit of improved operations caused due to increase in functionality."
 BUL_Crackdown_on_BRP: "Crackdown on BRP"
 BUL_Crackdown_on_BRP_desc: "Communist parties and trade unions are trying to destabilize our government by calling for a general strike and even an armed uprising. We need to make it more clear that this kind of behavior is no longer welcome in our new Bulgaria. We need to neutralize this leftover pest by liquidating the remaining communist organizations, including those groups that are still infiltrated in the army. Individuals with communist leanings will be hunted down and punished with all the weight of the law. If violence is the only language that these criminals understand, so be it."
 BUL_Reform_Wellfare_and_Education: "Reform Welfare and Education"
 BUL_Reform_Wellfare_and_Education_desc: "It is of utmost importance that for a brighter future of the country, quality education needs to be prioritised, a dedicated committee has been set up under the aegis of our administration, which will seek to implement stricter criteria for teachers, closing down underperforming schools. Along with this we’ll also be setting up a massive healthcare programme all about the country for our citizens to guarantee them a sense of security in time of their old age, the formation of such a healthcare programme would need to be completed as soon as possible to solidify a stable and robust societal structure in Bulgaria. To support such large public undertakings, a large amount of funds are needed, we are highly reluctant to take up loans but many believe the necessary capital can be secure by levying a special tax to support our ambitious public welfare undertakings."
 BUL_Schism_in_Military_Union: "The Schism in the Military Union"
 BUL_Schism_in_Military_Union_desc: "Our Country is relatively new in the tumultuous part of Europe, our country’s first and the main line of defense is that of our Army. To effectively partake in its duties of protecting our nation and enforcing the wills of the government, it needs to exist as a unified and efficient institution, which has become increasingly difficult. The main cause of such difficulties is the existence of two separate wings in the ruling circles and the Military Union, with time this schism will only grow wider and harm the national interests, and it is hence for the benefit of the whole country that their differences be soon reconciled."

 BUL_Standardize_Settlement_Names_desc: "The modern day state of Bulgaria is a relatively new geopolitical entity, embroiled sometimes willingly and sometimes unwillingly in conflicts between the European powers and the Ottoman Empire, our location as the gateway to the Orient made us party to numerous encounters among other nations. After shedding much blood and tears, both victories and defeats the modern day Bulgaria exists and that in a cultural limbo, the administration wants the assertion of a nationalist Bulgarian identity, but such an identity is difficult to foster when our towns are named in foreign languages and have streets named after foreign figures, Serbian, Greek, Romanian, and even Turkish names are all among them. After much discussion the government has issued the directive to start referring to the name of the cities only in the Bulgarian tongue in official documents and also encourage the populace to follow suit."

Although the economic clauses of the treaty have been renegotiated, the military clauses are unfortunately still in effect.

 BUL_Zveno_Threat_desc: "The Zveno, or \"Unit\", is a Right-wing political organization that seeks to create a Corporatist Bulgarian State.

While the current government of the Popular Bloc considers them a non-threat. The group has sympathizers in the Military Union, various Fascist organizations, and possibly the Tsar himself. An attempted Coup may hang on the horizon."
 BUL_IMRO_Terror: "IMRO Terror"
 BUL_IMRO_Terror_desc: "The Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization is a major source of instability in our neighbors. Although founded in 1893 seeking autonomy for the region in the Ottoman Empire, as of the Great War they’ve become the ultimate terror organization in the Balkans. They are responsible for the death of Prime Minister Aleksandar Stamboliyski in 1923, and various Cross Border operations from the Greeks and Yugoslavs over the years. From their base in Petrich, the IMRO has launched attacks across all of Macedonia, damaging relations with our neighbors. This threat has to be dealt with to secure stability in the region."
