 DNZ_Free_City_of_Danzig: "Free City of Danzig"
 DNZ_Free_City_of_Danzig_desc: "Ever since the Treaty of Versailles went into effect in 1920, the Free City of Danzig has enjoyed semi-independence on the Baltic Coast. The city-state is however heavily restricted by the Treaty, preventing it from taking any decisive action internationally, as well as banning any attempts for reunification with §Y[GER.GetNameWithFlag]§!."

 DNZ_Politics.1.t: "Resignation of Hermann Rauschning"
 DNZ_Politics.1.d: "Senate President Hermann Rauschning handed today in his resignation, during a tumultuous week for both Danzig and Germany itself. The news was not unexpected, with yesterday's massive purge of the Sturmabteilung by Hitler and German authorities. The casualties of the purge included two major allies of Rauschning, Sturmabteilung commander Ernst Röhm and politician Gregor Strasser. With Rauschning no longer in charge, his main rival Arthur Greiser has now been chosen as the new Senate President."
 DNZ_Politics.1.A: "Another casualty of the purge."

 DNZ_Politics.2.t: "Nazi Party takeover in Danzig"
 DNZ_Politics.2.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]News from the Free City of Danzig arrived earlier today, as the local Nazi Party under Gauleiter Albert Forster has won 50 percent of the votes in the Volkstag elections. Thereafter, the Nazis achieved dominance in the city government, which is still nominally overseen by the League of Nations' High Commissioner..\n\nThis win has surprised many, and shocked even more, seeing how initially the Nazi Party had only a small amount of success, with 0.8% of the votes in 1927 and was even briefly dissolved. However, it seems that its influence grew drastically by capitalising on pro-German sentiments, the onset of difficult economic ties and the increasing popularity of the Nazi Party in Germany..\n\nThe Nazis are expected to take control of the Senate in a few months, with Hermann Rauschning to become President of the Senate of Danzig."
 DNZ_Politics.2.A: "Another victory for the cause!"
 DNZ_Politics.2.B: "As long as they respect the Treaty of Versailles..."
 DNZ_Politics.2.C: "Danzig is German!"

 DNZ_LoN.1.t: "New High Commissioner Appointed"
 DNZ_LoN.1.d: "Today the new League of Nations High Commissioner, named Sean Lester, has been appointed to oversee our government. With the previous High Commissioner Helmer Rosting only being acting High Commissioner because of his predecessors sudden death in 1932, it seems that now things will return to normalcy again.\n\nSean Lester is an Irish diplomat, who is most known for being Ireland's Permanent Delegate to the League of Nations in Geneva. He is very involved in the work of the League, shown by him attempting to bring a resolution to two wars in South America, which earned him the attention of the League Secretariat at which point he began his transformation from national to international civil servant.\n\nIn 1933, Lester was seconded to the League's Secretariat and later sent to us to act as the new High Commissioner."
 DNZ_LoN.1.A: "Welcome to Danzig, Mr. Lester!"

 DNZ_LoN.2.t: "New High Commissioner Appointed"
 DNZ_LoN.2.d: "Today a new League of Nations High Commissioner has been appointed to oversee our government. His name is Carl Jacob Burckhardt and he will replace the previous High Commissioner Sean Lester.\n\nBurckhardt is a Swiss diplomat, historian and until recently a university professor at the recently created Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva.\n\nHis aim is to maintain the international status of Danzig guaranteed by the League of Nations, but with growing world tension and a conflict on the horizon, it will be very hard for him to successfully complete this mission."
 DNZ_LoN.2.A: "Welcome to Danzig, Mr. Burckhardt!"
