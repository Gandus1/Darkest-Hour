 UK_special.1.t: "Our Finest Hour"
 UK_special.1.d: "We now stand alone in the face of tyranny; The German war machine has overrun the continent with their new military strategy, knocking out the Low Countries and France in a single lightning-fast campaign. So far British diplomacy has not been fruitful in convincing others to fight alongside the Commonwealth, and it will not be long before the Luftwaffe will seek control over Britain’s airspace. Setting up a new ground-controlled network for intercepting enemy bombers will prove vital for protecting our industry. Let the Battle for Britain begin."
 UK_special.1.A: "We shall never surrender!" 
 
 UK_special.2.t: "The End of the Beginning"
 UK_special.2.d: "Allied forces have landed on the beaches of Europe, establishing a foothold following the operations of D-Day. The tide is turning, as more and more men and material are brought ashore, increasing our presence on the continent. Liberation is at hand for the many peoples of Western Europe, but even with plenty of boots on the ground it will still be a long way to Berlin. Yet, a successful land invasion can not be regarded as the end, and not even as the beginning of the end, but it is perhaps “the end of the beginning."
 UK_special.2.A: "To Victory!"

#  Commonwealth Events

 commonwealth.1.t: "Commonwealth Membership Questioned"
 commonwealth.1.d: "With the isle of Britain lost the United Kingdom can no longer be regarded as a one of the Great Powers, members to the British Commonwealth have started questioning the nature of the relationship. Even though advantages of remaining are few, a complete fracture of the Commonwealth would undermine the war effort. Others emphasise that independence is preferred now that the UK can no longer guarantee its member's security."
 commonwealth.1.A: "Leave the Empire"
 commonwealth.1.B: "Until death do us part"
 commonwealth.1.C: "Remain Loyal to London"
 
 commonwealth.2.t: "[From.GetName] leaves the Commonwealth"
 commonwealth.2.d: "One of our members has notified us that it no longer recognises the United Kingdom as its overlord, thereby resigning from the British Commonwealth. Alas, there is nothing we can do it seems."
 commonwealth.2.A: "Blimey!"
 
 commonwealth.3.t: "[From.GetName] remains Loyal to London"
 commonwealth.3.d: "Now that the transition of Britain is over, some of the fascist members of the British Empire have expressed their wish to remain a part of the new Britain, forsaking their old master."
 commonwealth.3.A: "For the Empire!"
 
 ENG_End_of_Newfoundland.1.t: "The Newfoundland Debacle"
 ENG_End_of_Newfoundland.1.d: "While the depression has hit the British mainland hard, we must not forget the effect it has had on our overseas territories. One place that has provided us a major headache is Newfoundland, as a number of issues that have spiraled from 1929 have threatened to get out of hand even further. The first of these and the most prominent is the economic crash. Newfoundland’s main export is fish, and its price has plunged recently, severely harming the income of the territory and the wider population of 290,000. The people and the merchants are running out of money, with many increasingly dependent on government relief to bail them out in these tough times.\n\nThe second problem is the collapse of faith in politicians and the government of the territory. Its government was suspended for a brief period of time in 1932 on the recommendation of the Newfoundland Royal Commission, and with no credit available to them, we were unsuccessful in trying to sell Labrador to Canada. On top of all this, the former leader of the government, Richard Squires, fell from power after being arrested for bribery in 1932.\n\nAfter much deliberation and debate here in the UK, a possible solution has been conjured up through the passing of a new Act: The Newfoundland Act 1933. This will help to provide “a rest from politics”, as well as clearing out corruption from the government. We will assume control of Newfoundland’s finances to try and fix them, and in return they will concede their self-governance, being replaced by a commission that will have executive and legislative authority. If this Act passes, it will surely bring much needed stability and calmness to the region that has been missing since those fateful days of 1929."
 ENG_End_of_Newfoundland.1.a: "Maybe some day they can return to responsible government"

 ENG.1.t: "The Jarrow March"
 ENG.1.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]In a turn of recent events, 200 men from Jarrow have decided to march from Northumbria to London in protest of depression conditions. They wish to give a petition to the Prime Minister and [ENG.address_leader_two]'s government to fund the reopening of their factories to get them back to work. It has gained support across the country from Labour MPs, local churches, and due to their non-violent law-abiding methods, they have gained huge respect across the nation. To many middle class, this is the first time they've truly seen the depressed areas. However, how the government reacts to the event could be very crucial."
 ENG.1.A: "Send Relief to Jarrow"
 ENG.1.B: "The [ENG.leader_title_two] wishes to receive the marchers"
 
 ENG.2.t: "The Crystal Palace burns!"
 ENG.2.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]'This is the end of an age.' remarked a solemn Winston Churchill as he joined the thousands who came to Sydenham Hill, in London, to watch a magnificent, yet astoundingly sad blaze, engulfing the great Crystal Palace. Opened in 1851 in Hyde Park, before moving in 1852 to its current, and final resting place, the great monument of glass and steel stood as a symbol of the proud British Empire. It was a beacon of industrial greatness, truly capturing the glorious spirit of the Commonwealth. Reportedly, there was a small explosion in the women's coatroom, which escalated into the inferno, now visible in eight different counties. Recalling the words of Churchill, the age of the British empire seems to be coming to an end, and, as new powers emerge, it is our duty to leave the global stage in a dazzling blaze of glory!"
 ENG.2.A: "This is the end of an age"
 
 ENG.3.t: "The Hobbit Published"
 ENG.3.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The children of England have been taken by surprise, with the publishing of \"The Hobbit, or There and Back Again\", by renowned author and war veteran J. R. R. Tolkien. The book carry readers by a magical quest, leaving them, child and adult alike, in absolute awe as the adventure goes on episode after episode, until it reaches the climax with massive battles that shape the fantastical world of the Middle-Earth. The critical and financial success of this work will surely embolden Tolkien's wish for a sequel, and the new fans will impatiently await to return this world they have learned to love."
 ENG.3.A: "Definitely worth a read!"
 
 ENG.4.t: "Royal Family Evacuation"
 ENG.4.d: "As the enemy forces roll ever forward onto the capital, the decision has been made in both Houses of Parliament as well as the Royal Household to flee to safety and command the war effort from there. As such, [ENG.address_leader_two] [ENG.leader_title_two] [ENG.leader_name_two] has ordered his family and the government to be escorted to Canada safely, himself being the last royal to leave London. Before leaving, he grants one final speech to the citizens and armed forces remaining in the city, telling them to fight strong, and no matter the cost to himself and his country, he shall return to rule this city once more."
 ENG.4.A: "God Save the King!"
 
 ENG.5.t: "Women, Children and Conservatives first"
 ENG.5.d: "It has been revealed that Conservative politicians have been secretly evacuating themselves before those of the Opposition parties. Samuel Herbert, Aneurin Bevin and especially Clement Attlee have denounced such ‘Selfishness in a time of the utmost Crisis’. The resistance to the ever marching armies continues, however the thought of their leaders being so petty has damaged the mental image of King and Country."
 ENG.5.A: "Tories..."

 ENG.6.t: "Preparations for a March"
 ENG.6.d: "Oswald Mosley is getting ready for a march through the streets of London. Fascism is on the rise; a civil war has broken out in Spain, and Hitler and Mussolini seem eager to fight us. He calls for a struggle in the \"Jew-ridden and communistic\" streets of Whitechapel, and many Blackshirts have rallied to his cause. He seems to want to provoke the communists into a full-out fight. We should probably intervene; the world seems geared towards another Great War, and we can't afford interior discontent. The only thing to do is to help one of the sides of this conflict. But which one?"
 ENG.6.A: "We must ban the march! No fascists in Britain!"
 ENG.6.B: "Allow the march."
 ENG.6.C: "Allow the march, and send a police escort"
 
 ENG.7.t: "Battle of Cable Street" # Cops
 ENG.7.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Violence erupted on the streets of London today. Various anti-fascist demonstrators, among them communist, Jewish, anarchist, and socialist groups rallied to oppose a march of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists. 6,000 - 7,000 bobbies were assigned to protect the nationalist demonstration, but were unable to clear the path of roadblocks set up by the counter-demonstrators. Almost 20,000 anti-fascists arrived to stop the march, and started a riot against the police as the peaceful march turned to bloodshed. What happens next remains too be seen, but this could end up as a victory for the communists, for the fascists, or perhaps bloodshed might be avoided."
 ENG.7.A: "Mosley calls off the march and flees."
 ENG.7.B: "The police manage to fight of the communists despite overwhelming odds"
 
 ENG.8.t: "Battle of Cable Street" # No Cops
 ENG.8.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Violence erupted on the streets of London today. Various anti-fascist demonstrators, among them communist, Jewish, anarchist, and socialist groups rallied to oppose a march of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists. Almost 20,000 anti-fascists arrived to stop the march, and started a riot against the BUF as the peaceful march turned to bloodshed. What happens next remains too be seen, but this could end up as a victory for the communists, for the fascists, or perhaps bloodshed might be avoided."
 ENG.8.A: "The communists turn back the fascists and Mosley is killed."
 ENG.8.B: "Mosley calls off the march and flees."
 
 ENG.9.t: "First Voyage of the Queen Mary"
 ENG.9.d: "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]After more than six years of construction, the grand ocean liner Queen Mary departed from  Southampton, England, and set sail on her maiden voyage to New York. Named after the wife of King George the Fifth, the ship was built in response to an influx of new passenger ships from Germany. Now she is seen as an accompaniment for the world to see. With 12 decks, 24 boilers, four steam turbines, a speed of 28.5 knots, a length of 1,019.4 feet,  and a capacity of more than 2100 passengers, many see the Mary as a staple of traditional and modern ship design. \n\nThe reported amenities on the ship are even more astounding, with kitchens, luxury rooms, tennis courts, swimming pools, salons, studios, and a grand ballroom in the middle of it all. Although the excitement wasn't as great when compared to the launch of the ship in 1934, the words of King George V still stay true: “May her life among great waters spread friendship among the nations!”"
 ENG.9.A: "Would a race with the SS Normandie be out of the question?"

 ENG.10.t: "Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement"
 ENG.10.d: "Due to the ongoing Anglo-Irish trade war we wish to ease economic tensions between us and the Irish to achieve prosperity among the British peoples, with this we wish to facilitate the 'Anglo-Irish trade agreement' in which the 20% tariffs both Ireland and Britain placed on their imported goods are to be abolished. Ireland is also to pay £10 million to Britain for the \"land annuities\" derived from financial loans granted to Irish farmers by the British government to enable them to purchase lands under the Irish Land Acts"
 ENG.10.A: "Sign it"
 ENG.10.B: "The Irish are insane"

 ENG.11.t: "Germany Calling"
 ENG.11.d: "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]A stray fox has left the woodlands. Born within our midst, William Joyce has turned his faith away from us. The known zealous Hitler-fanatic has left the United States and, with the European powderkeg's fuse about to catch fire, once more set foot on German soil to avoid confrontation with the authorities. His Nazi propaganda to Britain from Germany is a thorn in our side, which asks to be removed."
 ENG.11.A: "So you Germans believe that you can defeat the superior British forces! Haw, Haw."

 ENG.12.t: "The Blitz Begins"
 ENG.12.d: "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]The German Air force, on this night have begun a ruthless bombardment of London. The fall of France has brought about the greatest challenge in the history of Britain since Napoleon, we now face imminent threat of invasion by foreign German forces. The Luftwaffe has taken to the skies, attempting to take the will of the British people away, trying to take the fight out of us but we will not falter. \"Never was so much owed by so many to so few\" Prime Minister Winston Churchill has stated concerning the brave RAF fly boys who have taken to the skies to beat back the Nazi menace. This will no doubt be the greatest threat that the British isles has ever faced, Hermann Göring and his Luftwaffe will be a large obstacle towards our victory but through fire, fury and determination we will achieve victory against Göring's Luftwaffe and Hitler's Germany. The British people are staunch to the bone and this intense bombing of our homeland will only strengthen our morale, we shall never surrender and live on to the end, emerging victorious from the ashes!<For [ENG.leader_title_two] and Country!>"
 ENG.12.A: "Tragic!"

 ENG.13.t: "Coventry Bombing"
 ENG.13.d: "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]Damn the Irish, those fools. They know not of the greater evil that awaits them, the Axis powers that could very well soon control all of Europe. Aiding the Germans should not be the interest of the Irish; helping the Germans in bombing Britain only weakens us, and strengthens the wolf that will come for them when it sees fit."
 ENG.13.A: "Let those Irish be DAMNED!"

 ENG.14.t: "Altmark Incident"
 ENG.14.d: "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]The Altmark Incident may have angered the neutral and peaceful Norwegians, but they know nothing about the oppression and the tyranny that the Jerry's would enforce upon them if given the chance. Although in their territory, the German tanker was carrying almost 300 British Prisoners of War, that, had we not rescued, could have well been tortured and killed by the evil Krauts. The captured men knew about this and they started a revolt, so they can be heard by our inspectors on the ship. Even though the Norwegians might be upset about this, they should know that we would not violate their neutrality."
 ENG.14.A: "Surely nothing will come of this incident"

 ENG.15.t: "Their Finest Hour"
 ENG.15.d: "This is their finest hour. They conquered Western Europe in a few weeks. They now swim in the great spoils of victory... How could we allow such tragedy? This new tactic, \"The Blitzkrieg\", or Lighting Warfare, as they call it, was very effective and although they had a small number of tanks, they were sufficient for a speedy breakthrough, through the Benelux and down into the heart of France. The \"famed\" Maginot Line was a complete waste of time, as they just went around it. We wasted the lives of many men, just to be utterly destroyed on every front. They will bomb our ports, airfields, bases and even the cities, which are full of terrified civilians. We must not be afraid, even though dark times are upon us and even though they are already planning the naval invasion of the British Isles."
 ENG.15.A: "We will survive, as we did before!"

 ENG.16.t: "Occupation of the Channel Islands"
 ENG.16.d: "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]They've done it. They have stepped foot on British territory. The Channel Isles have fallen. They have destroyed France in so little time. Just the Germans. Our hopes for a quick Allied victory are destroyed, now it seems that this war will be an Axis victory. We must prepare for a desperate defense, the great defense of democracy in Europe. We will not fall, Britannia will not fall, Britannia will rule the waves and the winds. We will not let these \"Sauerkrauts\" think they are the leaders of the world, we will not let these National-Socialists destroy humanity just for their racial beliefs. We will never surrender!"
 ENG.16.A: "Damn those Nazis"

 ENG.17.t: "BBC Launches Regular Television Broadcast"
 ENG.17.d: "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]The BBC has opened the world's first regular high-definition television service, from Alexandra Palace! Mere 14 years after its founding on October 18th, 1922, having already broadcast His Majesty King George V, Edgar Wallace and Christopher Stone the British Broadcasting Corporation has once more set forth to conquer new fields of telecommunication."
 ENG.17.A: "Interesting"

 ENG.18.t: "Frank Whittle Ground-Tests the World's first jet engine"
 ENG.18.d: "Frank Whittle, despite being rejected in 1930 by the RAF for his proposal, has now been given the scientific spotlight to create a jet engine for the British war effort. These engines use high velocity aircraft to intake air, and then mix it with fuel before the exhaust gases are exhaled at rapid velocity. The proposal was rejected due to budget cuts in the RAF as well as doubts into its effectiveness, however he has now been given full attention by the Royal Air Force. If this could be placed onto warplanes, it could give Britain a decisive advantage in the air war, and therefore the battles themselves"
 ENG.18.A: "Interesting"

 ENG.32.t: "The Future of Warfare"
 ENG.32.d: "The way in which modern war is turning is quite clear. The future of warfare is a war of movement - mechanised, armoured and motorised armies control the battlefield and our tactics must adapt along with them. Thus, we have assembled the best and brightest military minds, two of which have come up with new and revolutionary doctrines on how we should engage the enemy - however, we cannot simultaneously adopt these doctrines, for they are quite different.\n\nLiddell has proposed a doctrine of war in which economics is used as a method to drain the opposing nation of will to fight, holding the defensive until the enemy has been weakened sufficiently, then beginning a war of movement, constantly keeping the opponent on their toes until their defeat is assured. Fuller has proposed the utilisation of armoured forces in concentrated divisions to bypass, surround and destroy enemy strongpoints. Both utilise new technologies, specifically armour, in a high capacity. However, Fuller proposes the utilisation of stronger and more numerous armoured attack forces, potentially winning the war faster but with a higher risk attached should it fail.\n\nWe can only pick one doctrine, however. What style of war shall cast our nation headfirst into victory?"
 ENG.32.A: "Go with the indirect approach"
 ENG.32.B: "Listen to J.F.C Fuller"
 
 ENG.36.t: "The Public Order Act"
 ENG.36.d: "With political tensions running high and extremism rampant, it is up to the government to curb such dangerous philosophies in the wake of an outward threat. The United Kingdom has been a bastion of democracy for over half a century, and we will not concede even an inch to those who wish to upset the balance. Henceforth, political marches must be cleared by local law enforcement before beginning, allowing us to cast a net over those we wish to censor for the greater good. In addition, donning political attire in a public meeting place is also banned, thus preventing virulent imagery to spread through our streets. The final tenants of the Act ban informal political militias, thus decreasing the chances of violent uprisings and ensuring the police can respond to crimes of all kinds, including those perpetrated for the behoof of a politician’s agenda."
 ENG.36.A: "Mosley must be neutralized at any cost."
 ENG.36.B: "We must look to our own people before intervening abroad."
 
 ENG.40.t: "Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat"
 ENG.40.d: "\"I have nothing to offer, but blood, toil, tears and sweat!\" These were the words of the former First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill, upon assuming the Prime Ministership after Neville Chamberlain's resignation.\n\nLong an opponent of appeasement, Churchill warned against negotiating with Hitler long before the war commenced. Now in charge of the war effort, his determination to see us through this conflict, no matter the cost, shall no doubt aid him, and us, in this time of great danger and desperation."
 ENG.40.A: "God Save the King, and God Save Churchill!"

The British attacked their former ally's flotilla with the stated goal of sinking as many ships as possible in the harbor to prevent them from falling into Axis hands. After France rejected a British ultimatum to hand over their fleet, which would have violated France's surrender agreement with Germany, the British commander gave the order for his naval force to fire on the French ships.\n\nFollowing the French surrender, the French agreed to keep their navy neutral in exchange for the Germans granting relative autonomy in the zone libre, the free southern part of France. However, both Hitler and Churchill were dissatisfied with this arrangement. Hitler feared that the French would eventually join the British in their fight against Germany, whereas Churchill feared that the French navy would be swallowed up by the Italian and German Navies.\n\nThis has been viewed as a complete and utter betrayal by French civilians, who are already suffering a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Germans. German propaganda is already working hard to make this story go viral. Philippe Pétain, the French President, has monopolized the attacks by severing diplomatic ties with the United Kingdom. The attack has sparked debate even within the United Kingdom.\n\nOthers, on the other hand, interpret it as evidence that the unwavering British resolve to win this war has not yet been overcome."

Those days were behind him anyway.\n\nThe love of his life sat down beside him, and he pictured her in a crown. In his mind, pillars rose, branching out and intertwining to form the vaulted ceiling of Westminster Abbey. Bright light streamed through stained glass windows, painting the pair in a saintly aura- a mighty King, with his Queen beside him. Majestic.\n\nHe saw in Wallis what the throne lacked- strength. Forcefulness. Vitality. The things that drew him to her and seized him like no woman ever had. The politicians back home hated his future wife- she was too ambitious, too American, too divorced. But why did that matter? He loved her, and that was the only important thing. Wallis noticed his distress and frowned in concern. If the crown was contingent on giving up love, he knew which one he'd choose."

 ENG_Abdication_Crisis.3.d: "Rumours have been circulating that King Edward VIII is planning a wedding in the coming months after secretly dating a married woman for several years. The Church has formally rejected these rumours, stating that he cannot marry a woman who has been divorced twice and that doing so would be detrimental to the Kingdom's reputation. The problem extends beyond the fact that she has remarried. The main reason, according to the Church of England, is that both of her ex-partners are still alive.\n\nThe King's deviant behavior has been reported to Stanley Baldwin's government. As a constitutional monarchy, the UK government cannot allow something like this to occur. "

I'm tired of all these mumblings, and all I want is a love marriage."\n\nBaldwin sighed. "You know the Cabinet would be furious about this, and the Governors of the colonies have already issued their opposition to this marriage, first and foremost the Governor of Australia, and they will not recognize this marriage in any form."\n\n"And how many people live in Australia?" Edward resisted. "Since when do I need them to give them my opinion on my marriage?" Stanley, my mind is made up; I'm not going to end my marriage over a squabble."\n\n"As you wish, your Majesty." Baldwin stood up and said, "I will convey your decision to the Cabinet and Parliament, though I cannot guarantee their response."

Many members of Parliament are even opposed to the king marrying his twice-divorced mistress in a morganatic marriage. Britain's dominions too have stated that no compromise is possible, and whispers of a general government resignation have begun to circulate in the House of Commons.\n\nEven the newspapers have begun to question the King's loyalty to the crown and the people, spinning speculative stories about how the King's judgment on other matters may be clouded based on how this issue is resolved.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the King listens to his critics and abdicates, but if he pursues his own desires, the consequences could be detrimental..."

This time, however, it was on the matters of the King and his proposed marriage.  The royal family and the majority of British politicians have been opposed to him marrying American socialite Wallis Warfield Simpson, so he communicated his desire and sought the support of the dominions. He proposed a morganatic marriage in which Wallis would have no rights to rank or property, as he had done to the other parties, in the hope that the dominions would see sense and side with him when everyone else was against him.\n\nHowever, it turned out to be exactly what Edward feared: rejection. While there were a few faces that appeared to be open to the idea, the majority reacted with skepticism, if not outright anger. Most people thought an American woman who had been divorced twice as a potential British queen was unsuitable. With everyone seemingly against him and nowhere to turn, Edward left the building to contemplate."

For months, the government had been working against him. How were all these men and industrialists able to attack their king? But now Edward was certain: the declaration he wished to make public will explain his motivations. They adore him, and they are his best chance of victory in this battle. The next morning, everywhere in London, the headline of the Daily Telegraph proclaimed:\n\n\"The Dangerous Dance of King Edward\"\n\nThere was no mention of the reasons for the King's marriage to Wallis Simpson in the article. In fact, the article chastised him for his support for far-right and fascist leaders. Notable examples included Mrs. Simpson's relationship with the Nazis, the king's reaction to the Italo-Ethiopian war, and even the support he received from Mosley's blackshirts. \"Who does the King truly serve, the United Kingdom and the Empire, or the fascist new order?\" asked the article's final line.\n\n\"Those backstabbers!\" Edward immediately dialed his last hope into his phone: the BBC. When the line was connected, however, the manager refused to speak with him. He knew exactly who was responsible for this. The king stormed into Baldwin's office, demanding to know why the BBC refused to speak to him.\n\"I'm sorry, Your Grace, but it looks like the people aren't interested in hearing your lies.\"\n\"Baldwin, how dare you? I must explain to the people how the government is attempting to depose their King!\"\n\"You will not!\"\nSilence followed until Baldwin firmly beckoned the king to leave.\n\"I apologize, My King.\"\nSlowly raising his gaze to Baldwin, Edward declared with royal authority:\""

 ENG_Abdication_Crisis.9.d: "Edward sat back and enjoyed the steaming tea in front of him. This tea was grown specifically for royal consumption on a specially chartered plantation in India. A little more difficult to cultivate, but naturally fresher, with a flavor described as a floral Jasmine and Ceylon combination with the malty character of Yunnan. The arose steam had a flavor and scent that never failed to bring the king to a state of calm.\n\nThe king’s attention shifted as he heard a knock at the door, followed by the entrance of Prime Minister Baldwin. He had been informed of his impending arrival; clearly, the visit was to discuss some important cabinet news. The king got a headache just thinking about those bureaucrats, and Baldwin was the worst of them all. There had been no end to the pain they had inflicted on him because of his marital choices. Edward motioned for the Prime Minister to sit, but the Prime Minister shook his head and stood.\n\n“Your Majesty, I’m afraid this meeting won’t be long. If you go ahead with your marriage to Ms. Simpson, the cabinet has threatened to resign. If you proceed, I have decided to stand with them and resign as well.\" Edward felt blinding rage at the news in an instant. His own government, abandoning him in this manner? The arrogance! The king suppressed his rage. It would be pointless for him to express his emotions here. The king spoke after a brief moment of thought.\n\"If that's all, please leave to think about this information.\"\n\n“Very well Sir”, replied Baldwin.\n\nAs Baldwin left the room, Edward's mind began racing with thoughts.  Where could this plot could have originated?  What could be the ramifications of this insane idea? And finally... how he was to react.  After a few minutes of deliberation, the king arrived at the only resolution he could accept. Taking a sip of his now-cold tea, Edward noticed that it was more bitter than usual."

The Church of England, which forbade divorced people from marrying, rejected the idea, but the King persisted and proposed a morganatic union instead.

 ENG_Crumbling_Empire.1.t: "The Fallen Bridge"
 ENG_Crumbling_Empire.1.d: "We have just received reports that the last pockets of organized resistance have surrendered to German forces in London. Small arms can be heard across the city, but no significant unit has remained after the final push to capture Tower Bridge and Vauxhall Bridge. The swastika now flies over Buckingham palace and the House of Commons. Big Ben was destroyed by a German bombing, and only the lower building of Westminster remains of what was one of the most iconic buildings in London and the United Kingdom.\n\nFortunately, the majority of the civilian population evacuated before the Germans arrived, but we can only pray for those who remained. Winston Churchill refused to evacuate, but it's likely that he left with the Royal Family, who evacuated well before the fall of the city.\n\nWhile London has fallen, the war must go on, but because it was one of the key cities in England, it'll be difficult to resist the German offensives. We must continue to battle the Nazis and prevent them from capturing the remainder of the United Kingdom."

He squinted his eyes, looking at something in the distance. Then, a look of pure dread appeared on his face. He slowed the car down and took a sharp turn onto a dirt side-road full of trees on each side, with the rest of the convoy following. Silence followed, with no one daring to take a breath. In the distance, multiple figures emerged, with dark grey suits, helmets… and guns. The commander turned his head back, whispering “Get your heads down!” The German patroller’s footsteps became louder, louder, then German laughs and talking came into range. Now they were right next to the clearing, with the armoured cars on the other side. But what was something of a miracle, and possibly drunk patrollers, they didn’t look over, and the footsteps slowly faded, along with their talking. The commander slowly lifted his head to look out the side window. Nothing in sight.\n\n“Bloody hell. Sorry for that, your Majesty, but no time to catch our breaths. We keep moving, and quickly.”"

They can’t be left alone, please sir!” Tears filled the father's eyes.\n\n“My kids need to be on that ship! They need to get out of here, who knows when another one will come! ” Another mother cried.\n\nA soldier addressed the crowd: “Folks, I’m sorry, but there just isn’t enough room. You’ll have to board another ship.”\n\nRight as the crowd of civilians was to make another plea, several armored cars rolled forward through the chaos of the port. Out came multiple MPs and rich aristocrats. A group of soldiers parted the crowd, and the guard of the ship’s entrance let them in without hesitation. As they boarded the ship, outrage began to fill the crowd.\n\n“You cowards! You’re leaving us to die!”\n\n“What happened to the women and children first policy, you bloody dicks!”\n\n“You’re supposed to lead and help us!”\n\nFood and garbage filled the air as people threw whatever they had at the elite. And they didn’t even look back at the people they were supposed to help, stranding them on the isles, and leaving them in the hands of the Germans"

 ENG_Crumbling_Empire.3.t: "Curtains"
 ENG_Crumbling_Empire.3.d: "“We live in a period, where…”\n\n“SHUT UP”, one of the guards shouted, ramming the end of his rifle into Mosley’s stomach. He had been trying to convince the guards that the end was inevitable and that the UK should accept its fate. Emotions were high in the prison cell where Oswald lay, bruised and bloodied, with each of the guards taking their turns to attack him and hurl insults towards him.\n\n“You fascist traitor! You think the Germans will save you? Hah! They’d make you nothing more than their little bitch.” John, a proud Labour voter, had never liked Oswald since the day he created the BUF, and had been a part of a mob that once tried to attack Mosley in his early days of fascism. And now he was in charge of making sure that the Germans never got to him; he had the final say over what happened to his enemy, Oswald Mosley.\n\n“There’s only one option we have in this hour of darkness: slay this fucker and leave him to rot in this wretched place”, exclaimed John. The others all looked at one another, nodding their heads in agreement. “How are we going to do it though?”, one of them asked.\n\n“In the most painful way possible”, snarled John.\n\nThey picked Mosley up and slammed him against the wall, and he was sobbing by now, trying to apologise and make up for what he said were “terrible mistakes”. “That doesn’t cut it now you slimy bastard. Bring him this way”, yelled John. The rest dragged Mosley into the courtyard of the prison, out into the cold bitter air of the night, and he was promptly thrown down onto the ground, kneeling and begging for mercy. The guards formed a line and waited for John's orders.\n\n“Ready… Aim… Fire!”\n\nAnd with four gunshots, the figurehead of British fascism was gone, snuffed out before he could betray anyone else. One of the guards poured a can of petrol over him, and John grabbed a match. Lighting his cigarette, and then Mosley's lifeless corpse, he watched all that anger, all that hatred, burn before him."

 ENG_Crumbling_Empire.5.d: "“We're leaving now, Prime Minister… you aren't coming, are you?”\n\nChurchill sat on the far end of the bed with a bottle of Champagne on his nightstand. He didn’t say a word, only looking down at the floor. The King closed the door and walked over to his bed, and sat next to him. The two sat for a few minutes until Churchill broke the solemn silence. \n\n“Do you ever regret asking me to become Prime Minister of this country?”\n\nThe king looked over, pausing for a second until answering. “Not at all. While I at first preferred Halifax at the beginning, and maybe it would’ve been better to sue for peace before the invasion, I don’t think anyone could lead Britain through this time better than you have. You will then, and always, have my support. Even with the buggers marching around London and my palace." Churchill chuckled to himself and grinned slightly.\n\n“Your Majesty, I will lead England to its last breath. Even then, its heart will live in every home, every street, and every mind of every British citizen. No matter where, no matter when, no matter who conquers our island, we will fight for freedom.”\n\nThe King smiled. “Yes, yes we will… and I know I’ve asked thousands of times before, but for one final time, please, you should come with us to Canada. If Britain does fall, we will need someone leading the fight in exile. We need you.”\n\n“Your Majesty, with all due respect, that is still one of your dumbest ideas yet. I don't know why you keep bringing it up.” The two laughed one final time together.\n\n“I will fight for this country until God takes me. If Britain needs anything right now, it’s their leader.”\n\n“That’s the Churchill I know. And let's be honest, you never took any of my advice anyways… Do you think  that I'll ever see you again, after all of this?\n\nChurchill looked over, “I won’t make any promises, your Majesty, but do know this: I will not leave this island until Britain is saved.”"

I will not let the British people see their Prime Minister as a coward who will flee with his tails between his legs!\" \"Understood, Prime Minister,\" the other side says over the phone, breaking the silence, \"I wish you the best of luck.\"\n\nWinston Churchill hung up the phone, walked over to his desk, and pulled out a drawer containing a Webley Pistol and a case of cigars. He lit up one of the cigars, took a big puff, and opened a bottle of Pol Roger, drinking as much as he could stomach. It might be the last drink he ever has, he reasoned. Noises began to come from outside his room, loud, heavy steps, steps too loud for any proper British gentleman, steps too heavy for any British of good manners.\n\nWinston knew exactly who was taking these steps, so he checked his Webley's chamber and cocked its hammer, waiting for the people outside the doors to come in for a proper welcome..."

St Paul's Cathedral had also failed to withstand the devastating forces and had been hit by several shells and other bombs. God too seemed to have fled England with the government.\n\nProbably the most tragic loss was the destruction of the left wing of Buckingham Palace.

The fallschirmjäger have also landed behind lines, capturing key buildings and radio towers.\n\nMultiple counter-offensives began as soon as the enemy landed, but because the Home Guard were untrained and the other British Army units were at half-strength and missing a lot of heavy weaponry, the attacks were repulsed and the Germans were able to continue their offensive to London.\n\nIt is unclear whether more landings will take place, but given their near-complete aerial superiority and vastly outnumbering our tanks, it will be difficult to mount a strong enough defence to successfully repel the German advance toward London."

 ENG_Oxford_Election.1.t: "Simon's Way Out"
 ENG_Oxford_Election.1.d: "\"There is no gambling like politics.\"\n\nThese are the words of Benjamin Disraeli, one of our finest Prime Ministers.\n\nWhen an opportunity presents itself in the world of politics, one must decide whether to gamble, or to restrain their urges, and hope for a better, more rewarding option down the line. Such a decision has fallen upon our embattled Foreign Secretary, John Simon, whose failure to denounce Japan's blatant expansionism in 1932, and inability to achieve anything of substance in the World Disarmament Conference has damaged his reputation in parliamentary politics severely.\n\nThe nature of this decision is simple. The recent death of Viscount Grey, a former Foreign Secretary himself, has created an opening as the Chancellor of Oxford University. Considering Simon’s long-held desire for the role and his weak political standing, it may be prudent for him to pursue a dignified end to his career and seek election for Oxford’s Chancellorship. However, taking into account the difficulties he will face getting elected, he may look to turn his fortunes around at the National Government, and achieve a lasting legacy at the Foreign Office.\n\nShould he look to pursue this opportunity, however, his replacement is likely to be a fellow National Liberal in the form of Walter Runciman, the current President of the Board of Trade, as the Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, wishes to prevent a member of the Conservative Party from occupying its office. Replacing Runciman, however, will be a trickier task, due to the National Liberals’ lack of numbers, and will likely result in a less influential Conservative joining the cabinet.\n\nSimon will need to make his decision soon, however, as the elections are coming up fast, and he will have to make up a lot of ground on Lord Irwin, the favourite to succeed Viscount Grey as Chancellor."

It is hardly unusual that every day some aspiring future leader of our nation is crushed in the wake of his foes and disappears from the political realm. It is just rare that one can recover from such depths - as Winston Churchill is about to do.\n\nAn influential and charismatic Liberal Member of Parliament when the Great War began, Churchill was made the First Lord of the Admiralty, tasked with overseeing Britain's naval effort. However, his downfall came swift - and in the form of the Gallipoli Campaign. A quick attack designed to knock the Ottomans out of the war spiralled into a stalemate, and as Allied forces were ordered to retreat, criticism rained down on Churchill. Holding numerous other cabinet offices since then, culminating in a short, but ultimately disastrous stint as the Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer, his downward spiral reached its rock bottom conclusion in 1929 when Labour won the general election. The Conservatives were out - along with Churchill, who barely managed to hold his Epping seat. In the years since then, he has been roaming the political wilderness, with his calls for greater efforts to rearm the nation furthering his condemnation into political isolation.\n\nOnly now has he been presented with a chance to serve the country once again and rehabilitate his image. As the replacement for Walter Runciman, the Presidency of the Board of Trade will afford Churchill the chance to show off his political skill and experience, but most importantly, allow him to form a loyal base of support throughout the Conservative Party, one that will vigorously back his calls for national rearmament and a strong, unyielding presence on the global stage.\n\nIt can only be onwards and upwards from here for Churchill. This could be his last chance."

 ENG_Indian_Reform.1.t: "Indian Governmental Reform"
 ENG_Indian_Reform.1.d: "The British Raj, a nation that many consider the jewel of our waning empire, is in a tricky situation. Ever since the end of the Great War, calls for greater autonomy have spread throughout the region, echoing right back here in Westminster. To act on this before things can get out of hand, a white paper has been published today outlining a new Act that should be brought before Parliament in the coming years, titled the “Government of India Act”. In the white paper, it proposes that major territorial changes be made, including the separation of Burma from the Raj and the establishment of Aden as a crown colony.\n\nOther talking points include the granting of more autonomy to provinces within the Raj and the creation of direct elections to further increase the voting franchise from 7 million to 35 million. However, while the Act has covered many areas to try and please as many as possible, other Members of Parliament argue that the Act should be split into smaller ones as it is too big for MP’s to make the right decision on this many matters at once. They propose that when the bill is brought forward in 1935, anything related to issues around Burma would be solved with the Government of Burma Act. This way, MP’s can digest the matters more easily, as making decisions on behalf of hundreds of millions of people is a daunting task."
 ENG_Indian_Reform.1.A: "Is India's future certain now?"

 ENG_Indian_Reform.2.t: "Finalisation of the Government of India Act"
 ENG_Indian_Reform.2.d: "Today, Parliament has begun proceedings to finalize and pass through the Government of India Act, something that will bring about major change to the Indian subcontinent. Along with internal government changes and the extension of the voting franchise, most attention has been given to the major territorial changes that are being made through the Act, which is being passed alongside the Government of Burma Act. The Government of India Act will see the creation of the crown colony of Aden while the Government of Burma Act will create a separate Burmese colony. This will allow for better administration of the region, while the government of the Raj being able to concentrate on other affairs more closely.\n\nWhile there has been praise from many MP’s for the bills, there has also been strong condemnation from those who both support Indian self-determination and those who are against it. Jawaharlal Nehru has called it a “charter of slavery” and “a machine with strong brakes but no engine”. Meanwhile, Winston Churchill, who has constantly campaigned against Indian self-governance, has said that the Act is “a gigantic quilt of jumbled crochet work, a monstrous monument of shame built by pygmies".\n\nWhatever the reception may be, one thing is for certain: there is no turning back from here."

 ENG_Ramsay_Events.1.d: "“Lord Baldwin, Mr. Chamberlain, can I talk with both of you for a moment?”\n\nThe call, sent with a strong but fading voice, came from the office of the Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald.\n\nRight away, the two men, who were waiting at the door, entered the office. Stanley Baldwin, the Lord President of the Council, had come here several times recently, but for Neville Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer, the occasions that he came here had reduced recently.\n\n“Thank you for coming so quickly gentlemen. I will not lie to you; my health has known better days. And I think you will have the same opinion to me that a good Prime Minister is one who is in good health.”\n\n“If I can contradict you, I think the faith in his ideals and his charisma are also the main qualities of a good leader!”\n\n“I agree with you Neville, but when old age arrives, it becomes very difficult to keep up strong charisma, and in turn, to defend his ideals. And because of my ailing condition, that is why I have called both of you.”\n\nHe opened a drawer in his desk, taking a folder and placing it in front of them.\n\n“In this folder are many key responsibilities which I want you to undertake when I cannot. That is if you accept of course. For example, I ask you, Lord Baldwin, to assist at the Geneva Disarmament Conference in November 1934.”\n\n“It will be an honour to help you Prime Minister.”\n\n“Glad to see we are on the same side gentlemen! There are some other things in this folder I ask you to take charge of, and I’m sure both of you will accomplish this tasks without any problems. Now, I must be leaving, as my tasks continue to grow despite sharing them.”\n\nAfter some last words, Chamberlain and Baldwin left the office of MacDonald.\n\n“Lord Baldwin, are you thinking the same thing as me?”\n\n“About the health of our MacDonald?”\n\n“Yes. Do you think he can stay here a long time despite this?”\n\nBaldwin took a few moments before responding to Chamberlain.\n\n“I think he will stay a few months, but for how long, who knows?”"

The ports have turned quiet, the factories have shuttered, and the mines have closed.

 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.1.t: "The Need for a Conference"
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.1.d: "The Wall Street Crash in 1929 and the Great Depression that followed it has hit nearly all nations of the world severely, including us here in the UK. While the initial shock wave was nearly four years ago, many are still jobless across the globe, and the need for the international community to come together is stronger than ever. Therefore, we have decided that an economic conference should be held here, in our glorious capital of London.\n\nBy having a meeting of various world nations, we will be able to coordinate the best possible way forward for, not only each individual country’s economy, but the global economy as well. There will be much to discuss during the conference, with topics such as the exchange rate and the stabilisation of foreign currencies. One area that is of great interest to us and the rest of Europe is the issue of debts to America from the Great War. We believe that by negotiating terms where the US government will be able to forgive our debts, it would help massively help in stimulating our economies, and, in turn, stimulating the recovery around the world. However, there is no guarantee they will agree to this, with one US Senator saying that “the troubles of the world are really due to the War, and to the persistence of Europe in keeping great armaments”.\n\nThe success of this conference will be key in speeding up the recovery of the world’s economy, as well as deciding if ordinary people will have to go longer without a job or food on the table. Failure is a possibility, but one we very much hope to avoid."

Many other nations have been invited to meet and help to try and find a way out of the devastating economic crisis that has shocked most nations of the world, ruining economies, and causing unemployment to skyrocket.\n\nThe conference will be held at the Geological Museum in London, with the aims of the meeting including agreements on the best way to fight the Great Depression, stabilise currency exchange rates, and to revive international trade, which has taken a severe beating as individual countries have sought to protectionist means to help their ailing economies.\n\nOur invitation to this conference is greatly appreciated, not least because our economy is in recession, and coming together with the international community to find a way forward is our best hope of having a strong recovery from the crisis.

 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.3.t: "The Beginning of the Conference"
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.3.d: "The day has arrived and all the delegations are here, 66 in total. Before any of the major discussions started, King George V gave a short speech, officially opening the London Economic Conference at the Geological Museum. An order of events was also read out, including the issue of European war debts to the USA, talks on currency stabilisation, and the revival of international trade.\n\nWhile none of the big issues were discussed today, there was a grand banquet in the evening, with the representatives of each country getting the chance to give small speeches and talk to each other. The mood seems jovial, but only for now, as there are bound to be disagreements between the nations, which includes us as well. \n\nAs the opening day comes to a close, we must hope that this conference brings about much needed cooperation to help the world climb out of the dark hole that is the Great Depression."
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.3.A: "We need this to succeed"

 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.4.t: "The Issue of the Great War Debt"
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.4.d: "The Great War had a massive toll on our country. The cost was too heavy, in both lives and money. We spent a lot on borrowing money to purchase weapons and supplies for our forces, and most of it came from the USA. This meant that we acquired a huge debt that is still yet to be fully paid back to them.\n\nWhile we had no problem at first, the Great Depression meant that we have had to decrease the amount we have been paying them each year, as we cannot afford to pay our debts and keep our economy running. The London Economic Conference now presents an opportunity to try and ask America if the debt can be forgiven, thus ceasing the need for repayments. Not only will this benefit us, as we can redirect money to our economic recovery, but we believe it will also benefit the USA, as a strong recovery here in the UK will help to revitalise and stimulate trade between our two nations.\n\nThere is no guarantee they will accept however, but we are close partners, and a good recovery in one nation is sure to help another."
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.4.A: "Surely they will accept?"

 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.5.t: "The British Want Us to Forgive Their Debt"
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.5.d: "We have been approached today by the British delegation at the economic conference regarding the issue of their unpaid debts from the Great War, as during the conflict, they borrowed large amounts of money to finance their efforts in the war. While the Great Depression has hit many nations hard, the British are struggling, as they are having to balance economic recovery with debt payment.\n\nThis has led to the UK representatives to begin discussions regarding the possibility of us forgiving the remainder of what they must pay. Their reasoning for this is that they will be able to spend more money on helping their economy, arguing that it would benefit us as well, as a strong recovery in the UK will revitalise trade between our nations, helping us in the long run.\n\nWhile it seems like a reasonable request, their direct payments of the debts owed to us means the money can go straight into our economy, giving quicker benefits for us, instead of having to wait for their economy to grow. Overall, it might be better to refuse their offer and make sure they continue with their payments, but then again, a speedy recovery in Europe could mean a speedy recovery here in the USA."
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.5.A: "Forgiveness will help us all"
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.5.B: "The debts must be paid in full" 

 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.6.t: "The Americans Forgive the Debt"
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.6.d: "Success! Our discussions with the US representatives in relation to our debts have ended with them agreeing to forgive them. This means that we can redirect much needed funds from paying our war debts into our battered and bruised economy. This will hopefully be the start of many more agreements at the conference, which could lead to greater cooperation between all the nations of the world.\n\nIt was thought that the Americans would refuse to forgive our debts, but luck is on our side, and we do not have to pay a penny more. The result of this decision could affect even those who are poorest in our society, as more money for the economy means more jobs for the people."
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.6.A: "The perfect result"

 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.7.t: "The Americans Refuse to Forgive Our Debt"
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.7.d: "Despite our best diplomatic efforts, the Americans have refused to forgive the debts we have to pay, demanding we continue to fulfil the necessary instalments. The reasons they cite for this decision include wanting to spend the money they get back on projects set out by Roosevelt’s New Deal, saying that it will help the US economy recover faster than if they were to forgive our debts.\n\nThis is disappointing, especially as the conference was called in hopes of a unified global response to the Depression, where countries would help each other out. While this will not stop other agreements being made, it does affect the plans we had made for our recovery from the crisis, and we must find other ways of helping the people of our nation." 
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.7.A: "An unfortunate response"

 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.8.t: "Currency Stabilisation Talks"
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.8.d: "Today, discussion has begun between Britain, France, and the USA, on the topic of currency stabilisation. President Roosevelt was sceptical of the idea of the talks at first but has instructed his delegation to continue with it anyway.\n\nThe plans are still being drawn up, but the British and the French have assured the US representatives at the meeting that any measures that are implemented will only be temporary, so that may bring the Americans around to the idea of currency stabilisation. The British and the French argue that the dollar should be stabilised by fixing it at a somewhat high value, while the Americans are in favour of devaluation of the dollar, as they say it would help improve their trading position.\n\nShould this succeed, it could help our all our economies recover quicker and stronger."
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.8.A: "An important and pressing matter"

 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.9.t: "The Plans Are Leaked"
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.9.d: "Multiple newspapers have confirmed that they have a hold of leaks confirming the recent negotiations between us and the United States. This wouldn't have been too much of a big deal if it were war reparations or loan debts, but of all things, it had to be the currency stabilization talks. Roosevelt confirmed publicly he wouldn't be involved in fixing currency prices, but with the possibility the president was considering a different plan, the US markets are bound for trouble. With the markets soon to be against him, our advisers are warning he’ll try to pull out as fast as possible. However, we can still try to persuade him to stay in while we have the chance."

Well, this time it wasn’t just paperwork on his desk, but a copy of The Washington Herald.\n\n“There’s been a leak, Mr. President, about our currency stabilization talks…”\n\nThe aid slowly pushed the print towards him. With doubt in his eyes, the president slowly sat up and looked down on the paper on his desk. To his dismay, in the top left corner, there was the headline in bold letters, ROOSEVELT CONSIDERING CURRENCY STABILIZATION.  His stomach turned, only wishing the market didn’t think too much of it. Those hopes were dashed right as he turned the paper over to the front page to see tanking stock numbers. After a deep breath, he let out an apologetic, “How?”\n\nThe aide shrugged. “But we don’t have much time for that, Mr. President, It’s out there.”\nRoosevelt tapped his fingers back and forth in a repetitive motion on his desk, before letting out a sigh. ‘There's no way we can consider going through with the talks now, there'll be too much push back from the market and export traders. All we can do now is damage control.” The president pointed towards his black phone."
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.10.A: "Get me Hull on the line"

 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.11.t: "Roosevelt Backs Out!"
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.11.d: "As we expected, Roosevelt backed out of negotiations right as the news of a leak hit the front page, even after attempts of filling the plan with escape clauses and temporary adjustments to try to keep him from doing so. Not only will he not agree to anything, but he also went as far as to state he won't talk about the subject anymore, probably to save himself from more stock market humiliation. Apart from the economic depression affecting every corner of the globe, the US was one of the main focuses of the entire conference, and with Roosevelt out of the picture, we can only hope we'll be able to salvage what's left."

Roosevelt condemned the idea In a message to the ongoing London Economic Conference. In the message, the President explained how "broader problems" exist and are far more important than a nation's currency rate. This comes after months of the President hinting he may have been more open to the idea, but he quickly changed his tone when papers were leaked from the conference showing Roosevelt was considering supporting such a plan.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald and rapporteur of the French Monetary Commission Georges Bonnet are reportedly outraged, with MacDonald commenting "Roosevelt's actions would destroy the Conference," and Bonnet being the most furious at the president after said to have "exploded" in anger. With the US officially backing out, many of the diplomats attending see little to no potential for more to come out of the conference."

Not to mention both the Banks of France and England are fully behind it as well.

Soon enough, the peace fled as the desk phone ringed its ear-piercing tune.\n\nHis secretary yelled from the switchboard room, "It's Hull, Mr. President, should I put him through?"\n\n"Yes yes, put him on."\n\nHe put the phone up to his ear. "What's the news, did you guys come to an agreement?" Hull answered happily through the fuzzy static. "I'm proud to say we did.

In other words, It's nothing we can't handle."\n\nRoosevelt smiled and let out a sigh of relief, "Well, that sounds like an acceptable proposal, tell them we're fully on board." After a quick goodbye, the president stared at the papers on his desk and wondered, would this actually do any good?"
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.14.A: "Better to try than not at all"

 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.15.t: "Roosevelt Agrees to the Plan!"
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.15.d: "Although it looked like the president would be stubborn to the very end on the topic of currency, our plan seemed to have pleased Roosevelt just enough, as Hull gave the plan a green light! With America's support behind the plan, all we really need to do is finalize the print and announce it to the people involved. However, due to Roosevelt's worry about what the public will think of it, we'll have to go along with how he wants it to be presented to the cameras. But this shouldn't be too much of an issue, so we can proceed as planned."
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.15.A: "Schedule a press conference in the museum!"

 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.16.t: "The Announcement of Temporary Measures"
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.16.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Gathered in a large room at the Geological Museum in London, US President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, and rapporteur of the French Monetary Commission George Bonnet stood in front of rows upon rows of diplomats, advisers, and secretaries to finally announce the long-waited Temporary Measures plan. In a short speech, MacDonald announced; "After weeks of planning and negotiating, we are proud to announce our plan of stabilizing the rate of currency between the US dollar and the currencies of Europe to counteract the effects of the current recession."\n\nThe end of his speech was met with a standing ovation, as many attending saw it as the main objective of the conference was finally complete. Even the US, which was fiercely against currency stabilization in the past, responded warmly to the proposal after Roosevelt gave a radio broadcast expanding the plan. With new measures in place, financial advisers see it as a coming end to the economic depression."
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.16.A: "The future looks a bit brighter"

 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.17.t: "The Hugenberg Proposal"
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.17.d: "As the London Economic Conference started to wrap up, a fairly surprising proposal was put onto the floor by Germany's Minister of Economics, Alfred Hugenberg. In an almost laughable attempt at getting Germany's colonial empire back, Hugenberg gave a speech proposing a program of German colonial expansion in Africa and Eastern Europe as a cure for Europe's current economic depression. Many advisers and diplomats thought he was joking at first, but when they realized he wasn't, outrage filled the room. Hugenberg and many German diplomats were made laughing stocks for the rest of the day as the press rushed to get every bit of info of his plan on the front page. Soon after the meeting, both the governments of the French and the Soviet Union submitted formal notes of protest.\n\nThe German government has formally said Hugenberg was only stating his personal economic views, and not those of the government. However, Hugenberg has stated the opposite, saying he was speaking on behalf of the government, causing further ridicule from the west. Either way, Hugenberg's proposal was clearly rejected."
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.17.A: "Quite embarrassing"

 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.18.t: "Hugenberg's Fate"
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.18.d: "Sending Hugenberg to the London Conference has proved to be a complete disaster. During a speech, the man proposed a program of German colonization in Africa and Eastern Europe to solve the world economic crisis. Even though that's what our great nation deserves, it was ridiculous and embarrassing as every German diplomat attending became a laughing stock at the conference after they realized he was serious. When other members of the cabinet tried to control the damage he caused by suggesting it was his own personal beliefs, he still refused to go back on his plan, saying "It was on behalf of the German Government" even though it clearly wasn't. Besides the humiliation, France and the USSR have submitted formal complaints about Hugenberg's "proposal", and we're left with the two options: Sacking him out of the cabinet or keeping him for the time being."
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.18.A: "Sack the idiot"
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.18.B: "It doesn't really matter"

 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.19.t: "An Unsuccesful Conference"
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.19.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The last officials have left the Geological Museum in London, marking the end of the months-long London Economic Conference. With a focus on the financial crisis, which is still at full force, many major nations attended to find a solution to the global problem. Even Germany presented an idea of re-colonization.\n\nHowever, it ultimately ended with no progress made. War debts and international trade were some of the topics focused on, but all eyes were upon a new plan of currency stabilization. After the US left the gold standard, many nations felt the exchange rate between the US dollar would be too volatile. To fix this, drafts of currency stabilization were made but were soon halted after President Roosevelt torpedoed the idea by condemning it in a letter.\n\nMany financial advisers have seen this as a sign that global cooperation in the depression will now be unlikely, using the conference as the reason why international intervention is too complicated to get anywhere. It seems the nations of the world will have to solve the crisis to their accord."
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.19.A: "We're on our own"

 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.20.t: "A Successful Conference"
 ENG_London_Economic_Conference_Events.20.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]As the last car pulled away from the curve of the Geographic Museum in London, a mark of accomplishment had been left behind. Although the conference is officially over, its effects will be long-lasting. War debts and international trade were some of the main topics focused on, and even German colonization in Europe and Africa was discussed. But, all eyes fell upon a plan for currency stabilization, which was still hotly debated at the time.\n\nHowever, through weeks of perseverance and negotiations, Roosevelt, MacDonald, and Bonnet presented a plan that fitted everyone’s needs. By providing a stable currency rate, the plan will counteract some of the effects the recession has on the market. It might seem small, and some don’t agree with what was drafted, but a feeling of hope has replaced the darkness the depression was holding for many years. "

 ENG_Wartime_Tree.1.t: "His Majesty's Most Loyal Enemy Aliens"
 ENG_Wartime_Tree.1.d: "An enemy alien is any native, citizen, denizen, or subject of a foreign country or government with which a domestic country or government is at war. Typically, nations have declared war on one another by this time.\n\nPeople who had fled Nazi persecution, particularly Jews and political refugees, have found refuge in our country since the beginning of the war against the German Reich and the Axis powers. The majority of them were relocated to the Isle of Man, where we also housed Enemy Aliens during WWI. At the start of the war, approximately 70,000 German and Austrian residents of the United Kingdom were designated as enemy aliens.\n\nInitially, they were used by the Pioneer Corps to aid in fortification and military construction. These men, dubbed "The King's Most Loyal Enemy Aliens," later served in fighting units and saw active combat. Some were recruited as secret agents by the Special Operations Executive (S.O.E.)."
 ENG_Wartime_Tree.1.a: "Alle waffen gegen Hitler!"

 ENG_Wartime_Tree.2.t: "Our Darkest Hour"
 ENG_Wartime_Tree.2.d: "A wave of evil has swept across Europe. Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium are currently under German occupation. France is clearly not going to last much longer, and Britain and its Empire will be the only ones standing against the war machine. It’s clear we've entered our darkest hour.\n\nThe House of Commons reflected this attitude. With Britain soon to be alone in the fight, a sense of hopelessness has gripped the country. Peace talks have been proposed, and the war appeared to be unwinnable at this point.\n\nAs Churchill approached the house table, the Commons fell silent. And, for the second time, he gave a speech about the war. One that is more electrifying, humbling, and powerful than ever before...\n\n“Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender!”\n\nThe Commons broke out into several cheers.\n\n“And if, which I do not for a moment believe, this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old!”\n\nThe commons proceeded to explode into excitement. Several Labour MP’s cried, and Conservatives cheered louder than ever before. Churchill turned to a colleague and muttered, “And we’ll fight them with the butt ends of broken beer bottles because that's bloody well all we've got!”"

 ENG_Wartime_Tree.6.t: "Tizard rejected"
 ENG_Wartime_Tree.6.d: "Despite spending months in the USA, our delegation will return to London tomorrow without any new technology from the Americans. Congress has completely rejected our proposal for cooperation, viewing their intervention in our research as a threat to the stability of the policy of isolation.\n\nThe government has dramatically stated that it has been the worst diplomatic failure in the world since the declaration of the Franco-Prussian war in 1870, also saying that “much is at stake because of this”. The expedition's leader, Henry Tizard, is disappointed, but he assures the government that he will continue to develop the technology required to win the war, even if it means killing himself at work.\n\nThe government has quickly reassigned him to a new mission, developing our own RADAR technology, and, if he believes he is capable, the development of our own nuclear program. At the same time, the rejection of our proposition by the Americans has launched a cooling of our mutual relations. We will never have the same relationship with the US as no one is quite sure what the future of our diplomacy will look like with them."
 ENG_Wartime_Tree.6.a: "A failure for the Allies, or a benefit for British science?"

 ENG_Wartime_Tree.7.t: "Tizard triumphant"
 ENG_Wartime_Tree.7.d: "The Tizard delegation has good news! After months of back-and-forth negotiations, the Americans have finally decided to assist us! And, contrary to popular belief, they will not only provide us with assistance, but will also assist us in the development of our RADAR plans, as well as in its installation for use in a variety of areas. Some of their scientists also seem to have been impressed by our research on the atom, and they have indicated their willingness to work on this with us in the future.\n\nThis is a huge success for our government, and military industrialists have already begun to develop RADAR-equipped planes and submarines. The Americans, on the other hand, are very impressed by the British delegation's effectiveness and have asked Professor Tizard to stay in America with the American delegates for some time.\n\nIn the Prime Minister’s cabinet, everyone has agreed on the fact this operation is the biggest achievement of the century for the British services, and we think it can, in the long run, lead to the end of American isolationism."

 ENG_Hurricain_desc: "Rather than accepting the new, experimental models as the backbone of our Fighter Command, we have reached the conclusion that the concepts proposed by Hawker's Hurricane, of reliability and power under the well known design of a stiff, bulky monoplane, will be the most effective way of protecting our skies. It's perfect for interception missions against enemy attackers, and simple enough that the squadrons themselves can be tasked with repairs without any external support. Thoroughly tested and improved since its inception, such a piece would greatly improve the effectiveness of our air defenses."

 ENG_Advanced_Striking_Force_desc: "Our air force is getting old. So old in fact, that we could only wish to compete with those of other countries. Therefore we must modernise it. We shall build many tactical bombers, which will surely strike fear in our enemies, we shall also order some CAS Fighters, to support our mighty soldiers and our brave RAF pilots will be trained even more. We will surprise our enemies with these new sets of planes, we will make them fear for their lives."

 ENG_Area_Bombing_Initiative: "Area Bombing Initiative"
 ENG_Area_Bombing_Initiative_desc: "An expansion of our offensive air capabilities is on the line. We have to combat the current dire situation of the RAF Bomber Command. Its lack of size and technology renders it nearly useless for large scale operations over foreign territory. Inaccurate bomb dropping, outdated planes and above all, the lack of financing. The Spanish civil war has greatly shown the effectiveness of modern bombing raids, crippling both civil morale and industrial- as well as economic capabilities. It is therefore our deed to pick up on that recent military technological development and vastly expand our bomber fleets."

However, we have no effective way of supporting those ships far from friendly shores. We must build some mobile airfields, better known as carriers, which will be the home of new naval airplanes. We shall equip them with of our most modern equipment to make sure that, when they meet our forces, not only will they be defeated, they will also run in fear and will regret challenging Britannia and its mighty fleet."

This will enable us to track any incoming submarine, allowing us to either flee or destroy the submarine before it hits our convoys."

 ENG_Advanced_ASW_Tactics: "Advanced ASW Tactics"
 ENG_Advanced_ASW_Tactics_desc: "Although we have progressed a great deal in our submarine technology, the methods to counter them have always been ad-hoc and shaky at best, like using barrel bombs or, sometimes, planes. These independent strategies have been time and time again proven ineffective and hazardous, that is why we shall establish a strict protocol for search-and-destroy task groups, where both the Air Force and Navy will work in tandem to dissuade, capture or destroy future enemy submersibles."

Using concentrated mechanised forces and air power as detailed in the '1919 Plan' can breach holes in the enemy's lines through which rapidly moving formations can advance and surround, cut off and destroy strongpoints, bringing total victory in the field and assuring us victory in the overall war. This style of war can easily end wars quickly if pulled off correctly. Economic war is dishonourable, brings about needless bloodshed overall and does not account for if the enemy can break through our own lines, while Direct Warfare ensures that honor is maintained and total victory assured. We will not have another Lost Generation, and the Iron Fist of Albion shall assure it!"

There are some radical theorists out there, like J.F.C. Fuller and B.H. Liddell Hart, who believe that the use of tanks and motorised vehicles, is the way forward. They may well be right in the long run, but the concept of large-scale armoured warfare that they are proposing is just that, a concept and is therefore unproven in its effectiveness.\n\nWe must develop our military doctrine beyond the trenches and utilize new technologies, there is no question about that, but we will not put our faith in these radical, untested theories, lest they completely fail and result in the safety of the British Empire being put into jeopardy."

 ENG_Pacific_Fleet_Carriers_desc: "The advancements in aviation have not only seen great changes in land warfare, aircraft carriers are becoming more numerous and important by the day and as the cogs of war start turning ever more quickly, the need for these plane-carrying behemoths is rising by the minute. Especially the prolific Japanese and American navies are investing heavily in this field, making sure that the skies are never empty above the pacific. We cannot afford that our Royal Navy falls behind on this matter and loses its power in the pacific and therefore it is instrumental that our Pacific Fleet be equipped with more and better carriers so that it may stand side by side with both the US Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy in the pacific."

But, since the slow pace of naval war is what defines it, accelerating it is the key to getting the upper hand on our enemies. Therefore, making the next generation of Battleships not just harder and deadlier, but also faster will be instrumental to retaining our rule over the seven seas. In the steady and slow-moving arena of the sea those who wield the mastery of speed will be victorious."

 ENG_Battleships: "Battleships"
 ENG_Battleships_desc: "Ever since the beginnings of house Tudor our nation has been at the helm of naval technology, always pushing the boundaries of what was possible, what could be put into water. When the HMS Dreadnought left harbor in 1906, the people couldn’t believe their eyes: it was as if we had taken a fortress and put it into water. But that was just the beginning, that was just a glimpse of what ships in modern war would be like and the time to take the next step in the history of navies has finally come. Once again, we shall awe the world and build ships that will make the Dreadnoughts of the Great War seem like toy. We will develop and build Battleships so massive and awe-inducing, so heavy that no other name than “Super Heavy Battleship” will do them justice. And once these behemoths leave harbor, once our enemies are faced with the biggest ships ever to set sail, they will remember who it is that rules the seas."

It is time to make a public acknowledgment of our resolve against it.\n\nOur Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, will stand and make a speech, outlining the terrible effects of a fascist dictatorship, and targeting Italy as a primary example. Mussolini's seizure of power in Italy is only an early demonstration of its violent properties, with foes to his iron fist eliminated without question. Italy has become a dangerous place to live.\n\nNow, larger groups of fascist radicals gather in nations like the Spain, Austria, and Germany. Should the British Empire stand passive against this threat, there will be destructive consequences. Baldwin's speech will serve well in informing the general populace of this evil that cannot be ignored."
 
 ENG_Baldwins_Rearmament: "Baldwin's Re-Armament"
 ENG_Baldwins_Rearmament_desc: "Despite rising tensions in Europe and Asia, rearmament is still incredibly unpopular among the British public. The Peace Ballot has shown that the people prefer economic sanctions and diplomatic action through the League of Nations over armed conflict. The Labour-led opposition and its leader, Clement Atlee, also strongly oppose any effort to expand the armed forces.\n\nThe Royal Air Force, in particular, has fallen behind its continental counterparts; intelligence suggests the German Luftwaffe will soon be superior to the RAF both in numbers and in aircraft production capacity. Despite its unpopularity, at least limited rearmament is necessary for the nation's defense.\n\nThe Air Ministry suggests building aircraft manufacturing facilities 'in the shadow' of existing automobile factories, allowing them to draw on existing engineering expertise. Additionally, should the worst come to pass, automobile production lines can be converted to build aircraft instead."

From 1914 to 1919, the national debt increased a hundredfold, and by the 1920s, HM Treasury was spending more on repaying the Americans than funding our armed forces. Despite this somewhat embarrassing state of affairs, we were slowly repaying our loans, and it seemed we would eventually square our debt with the Americans.\n\nUnfortunately, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed made continued payments impossible. Recognizing this, President Hoover granted a one-year suspension of all war loan payments in 1931, but it wasn't enough for us to get back on our feet.\n\nLike so many debtors, we will have to ask for more time. HM Treasury suggests that we ask the Americans for another suspension of payment until the economy recovers."

Thousands of years of culture and heritage on this steadfast island must stand.\n\nEven if it means we have to play as the 'coward' for once in the vast history of this empire. Members of the current government believe the horrors enacted on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles were overly harsh, and suggest we sit back and watch as the Reich recovers. From there, we can see their true intentions. The doctrine of appeasement is being contemplated as our new foreign policy to the enemies that plague us. Victory must come over pride.

Someday, the price of peace may be too high; and when that day comes, we must be ready to fight for it. Britain will not give up all she bled for with the stroke of a diplomat's pen.\n\nWhile we will spare no effort to find a peaceful solution to the crises that threaten the international order we built in Paris, none shall forget Britain paid for that order in blood.

We starved the German populace into surrender.\n\nNow that tensions with Germany are arising once more, we may need to starve them again. Most crucial to the completion of this mission is to choke out the sources of their resources. Namely, Sweden and Romania. These two nations pose a grave threat to us should they trade with Germany during a prospective conflict. Sweden can provide essential tungsten to fund the German war economy, while Romania hosts vast oilfields in Ploiești that may fuel German mobile units and aircraft. Securing their loyalty to the British Empire, and only the British Empire, will be enough of a guarantee of their proper neutrality.\n\nWhatever actions must be taken to preserve this glorious empire will be carried out.

He was scared of everything, and thus he agreed on anything the Germans wanted. The British soon saw what Chamberlain really was – a weakling. Churchill has promised to be a better and stronger Prime Minister, and so far, has lived up to it. Instead of hoping war wouldn't demolish Britain,  like Chamberlain, he makes sure that it doesn't happen. Churchill has proven to be a strong man.

We have already begun laying the foundations of exploiting this potential by constructing the infrastructure necessary for further expansion.\n\nThe monetary cost of making these investments in Sub-Saharan Africa will be considerable, but being able to fulfill the potential for industrial growth in these rather untapped regions will more than make up for it in the long run."

As if there are any threats from the land. But as time has gone on, many of the cabinet have started to come around to this idea, and perhaps it would be wise to set up some fortifications on land and attempt to protect Singapore to the North. It may be a waste of time and effort, but perhaps being able to sleep safer knowing we did our bit, just to be sure, might make it worth it."

Instead, MI5 has informed us that they could monitor Mosely closely through listening devices and spies in the BUF, making sure he isn't plotting anything dangerous against the government or the country.

Around 200,000 houses are being built every year, and this has welcomed new industries into the area. Electrical companies are producing large amounts of electricity for the new houses, mass production methods have brought new products for the middle class, and the motor industry has boomed with the growing population. This potential has now been realized, and we should continue to stimulate new growth."

 ENG_Keep_Textiles_Afloat: "Keep Textiles Afloat"
 ENG_Keep_Textiles_Afloat_desc: "Since the Industrial Revolution in Britain, the textile industry has been an important player in the British economy. Textile production has led to industrial and scientific advancements in the coal and iron industries, which boosted raw material imports and improved transportation. These combined made Britain a global leader in trade, science, and industry. However, the demand for textiles has plummeted since the Great Depression, leading to a complete halt in the industry. To keep our economy growing, and jobs opening, we need to assist the textile industry through subsidies, mainly in Lancashire and Manchester, where textile factories are most prominent. This way, textile companies can profit more and continue to stay open."

From the times of the Roman Empire to the smoggy smoke stacks of London, coal has played an essential role in building the British economy for centuries. Steel, while relatively a newer product compared to coal, has built up our grand cities, inventions, and the many homes our families live in today. But not even these two super giants of the industry could be saved from the depression’s wrath. British shipbuilding, which uses coal and steel extensively, ground to a halt due to limited demand and funds, and as the ports slowed, the mines and factories closed as well due to a drop in demand. To stop this chain reaction, we’ll provide coal and steel companies with subsidies and loans to make sure they stay open."

While the National Physical Laboratory’s Radio Department has proven this to be impractical due to its energy requirements, scientist Watson Watt has pointed out that it could be possible to detect them with EMF radiation. Our RAF commanders have convinced the Air Ministry to O.K. the development of new RDF radio towers, but they have one condition: it can’t interfere with grouse hunting.

Without ships being built, there's no need for coal to run them, and there's no need for steel to build them, creating a chain reaction that's plummeting both industries into the ground.

 ENG_Raise_Tariffs_on_Imports_desc: "Drastic times call for drastic measures. While tariffs have always had a bad tune associated with them, the economics are simple: imported goods will cost more, and our goods will cost less. In theory, this will boost our economy and promote manufacturing in our country, rather than somewhere else. It can be a dice roll, however. Sometimes businesses will decrease trading altogether when tariffs are raised, resulting in even lower profits than before. But Britain’s trade economy, while wounded right now, is vital to many countries around the globe, and it won’t hurt to raise the normal tariff prices a little higher to generate more income. In the end, the faster England gets back on her feet, the better for everyone."

Having served as their PM on two previous occasions, Baldwin has enjoyed significant influence over the Conservative party since the 1920s- but it was during his time as leader of the opposition that he began the process of reshaping and reforming the party.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1931, Baldwin massively overhauled party structure and policy, professionalizing the ranks of party functionaries and embracing the utility of modern mass media such as film, radio, and television. Under Baldwin's leadership, the Tories have shifted slightly to the left, accepting the welfare state and entering a coalition with Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government. Despite this, the party has maintained its historical ties to industry, the aristocracy, and armed forces, granting them considerable political capital."

Their desperation to get it abolished leads them to turn and follow radical parties, who promise salvation, without logical reason. The full hatred of the German Reich targets France and the British Empire. It is our responsibility to reach out to Germany and discuss the future of this treaty.\nOur delegation will meet with German representatives in Berlin. A public acknowledgment of the cruelties of this treaty will help the Germans understand our stance on the situation, if only subtly.

Such a tool could end the war within the matter of days, saving millions of lives in the process. Britain's help with such an achievement could very well be our salvation."

The Peace Ballot has shown that the people prefer economic sanctions and diplomatic action through the League of Nations over armed conflict. The Labour-led opposition and its leader, Clement Atlee, also strongly oppose any effort to expand the armed forces.\n\nThe Royal Air Force, in particular, has fallen behind its continental counterparts; intelligence suggests the German Luftwaffe will soon be superior to the RAF both in numbers and in aircraft production capacity. Despite its unpopularity, at least limited rearmament is necessary for the nation's defense.\n\nThe Air Ministry suggests building aircraft manufacturing facilities 'in the shadow' of existing automobile factories, allowing them to draw on existing engineering expertise. Additionally, should the worst come to pass, automobile production lines can be converted to build aircraft instead."

## Special Ideas
 ENG_our_finest_hour: "Our Finest Hour"
 ENG_our_finest_hour_desc: "With France defeated most people figured that Britain wouldn't last another 6 weeks. They underestimated the spirit of the British people and their government. They bore themselves that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth lasted for a thousands years, men would still say this was their finest hour."

 ENG_end_of_beginning: "The End of the Beginning"
 ENG_end_of_beginning_desc: "We have seen many battles and though the war is not yet won, Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning."

 ENG_Pax_Britannica: "Pax Britannica"
 ENG_Pax_Britannica_desc: "'War would end if the dead could return'\n\nEver since the last guns fell silent on the French and Belgian fields almost two decades ago the Empire has seen itself in a state of tranquility. While the fires of the revolutions tore Central and Eastern Europe asunder the Empire could happily rest on its laurels knowing that the greatest war mankind had ever seen was over and they were the winners. Perhaps not everything was fine within the Empire itself, the usual Westminster squabbles resonated within the chambers of the Commons and the Lords and from the other sides of the sea the Dominions might cry out.\nBut every man, woman, and child in Britain can rest easy knowing that tomorrow there will be no more bloodshed, and that time will heal the wounds wrought by the past as long as the sun has not yet set on the Empire."

But endure they must, because that is the way of the English, through perseverance and pride we shall stand, for it is the burden of the Englishman to stand alone as the noble lion stands watch over his territory whether in times or bad."
