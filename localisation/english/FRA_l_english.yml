 FRA_National_Lottery.2.t: "First Draw of the National Lottery"
 FRA_National_Lottery.2.d: "The first draw of the new National Lottery has taken place at the Trocadéro Palace in Paris, bringing a crowd of five thousand people. The lucky winner was a married fifty-year old hairdresser from Tarascon called Paul Bonhoure. Thanks to his clerk that bought the winner ticket with the number 18414, the hairdresser won the considerable sum of five million francs. However, Bonhoure is already receiving death threats from several people mad at him from winning the prize, so we'll recommend the following winners to be more discreet about it from now on."
 FRA_National_Lottery.2.A: "Good for him."

 FRA_SFIO_Election.1.t: "XXXth Congress of SFIO at Paris"
 FRA_SFIO_Election.1.d: "The building was packed. Party members moved across the crowd, currying political favour with every person, enacting schemes, some of them merely coming across friends and avidly discussing what was about to occur. The Neo-Socialists had led the SFIO for quite some time, and two of their members were set on becoming the leader of the party.\nLéon Blum watched the members across the massive room in which they had congregated in. There was not a moment that would go by where he wouldn’t notice someone eyeing him, as though keeping an eye on him for any show of weakness. If he wasn’t so used to it by now, it’d be nerve-wracking. He’d look back upon some of the less experienced members, matching their glare and making them jump out of their skin as though they’d just seen a ghost, making them look away. It gave him quite a laugh - something he needed right now.\nPierre Renaudel sat across from Blum, giving generic responses to some correspondents and lobbyists. Such was the life of a man who had to bear the burden of being labeled a traitor to the revolution; perhaps more so than Blum - for it was Renaudel that brought the SFIO into the Sacred Front unified governmental party in 1914 for the Great War, giving the French Government the political backing it needed to fight the war in full capacity. Many blame him; say it is his fault the revolution has not come to France yet. And what hypocrites they are, Pierre thinks. Such successes we have written in the name of the working class… and after today, more shall be written with his hand on the pen. Right? His own doubts plagued him as the assembly finally drew to a silence.\n\"My fellow gentlemen, we are gathered here at the Thirtieth Congress of the SFIO - and the time has come once again for the people’s representative to be chosen. He will carry the burning flame of French revolutionary spirit with him as he goes onward - and may it give him strength in his duties.\" He looked down at the envelope passed to him by a final adjudicator.\n\"The elected torchbearer of the French people is…\""

 FRA_Milices_Fascistes.1.t: "Marcel Bucard Creates Francisme"
 FRA_Milices_Fascistes.1.d: "The French political drama continues as a new party enters stage right. Inspired by the fascism of Benito Mussolini, war hero Marcel Bucard's Mouvement Franciste upholds nationalist, authoritarian, and antisemitic thought, hoping to transform France into a fascist dictatorship in the mold of Italy.\nBucard has bounced around the far-right since 1918, first as a member of the royalist Action Française and later joining Georges Valois' Faisceau, Solidarité Française, and Croix-de-Feu. Seemingly unsatisfied with these groups, Bucard decided to strike out on his own; Mouvement Franciste is arguably more radical than any preceding groups.\nWhile still relatively small, with around 10,000 members, the movement edits its own newspaper, Le Francisme, and operates a paramilitary known as the Blueshirts. MF's disproportionate level of activity compared to its size has many wondering how the movement funds itself, with some directing their gaze across the Alps to Rome. While most of France views the movement with indifference at best, Bucard's words under the Arc de Triomphe resonate with a not-insignificant fraction of the population."

 FRA_Milices_Fascistes.2.t: "Dissolution of Armed Militias"
 FRA_Milices_Fascistes.2.d: "The Council President, [This.GetLeader], finally passed a law against militias today.\nThe "Law for fighting groups and private militias" grants the President the authority to dissolve any groups that he believes pose a threat to the country's security.\n\nFollowing the crisis of 1934, the presidential office decided to take harsher measures against far-right leagues. Despite his original goal, which is to oppose the right, a few observers have noted how ambiguous the text is written. In fact, the law never specifically designed militias, and some believe that the government may use this weapon in the future to dissolve other political parties, whether from the right or the left.\n\nThe Council President [This.GetLeader] has once again called for calm in the streets, but despite a few cries of rage from the leagues, the vast majority remained calm, and the government is optimistic about the future of this law, claiming that "the dissolution of militias was the only thing France needed to be complete again!""

 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_1.1.t: "Director of Bayonne's Crédit Municipal bank, Gustave Tissier, Arrested for Fraud"
 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_1.1.d: "The headline of the newspaper “Le Monde”:\n\n“The Bayonne bonds Affair” \n\nEarlier today, Gustave Tissier was arrested for selling thousands of worthless bonds to innocent French citizens. Director of the Bayonne’s CM bank, Tissier is accused of the diversion of more than 235 millions of francs.\n\nIn recent weeks, the local police have received numerous complaints accusing the Director of the local Crédit Municipal branch, Gustave Tissier, of stealing their money. This is a common accusation levelled against bankers, but the volume of accusations was so high that the police were summoned to Tissier's home.\n\nFollowing his arrest, police discovered overwhelming evidence in Tissier's office. Thousands of papers, with names, addresses, and written proofs from the man himself: the bonds he fabricates himself, without any value, but who can't be distinguished from a normal one by a non-specialist. Even more disturbing, when the office was searched, the police opened a small safe containing banknotes and gold bars.\n\nOne of the witnesses, the young brigadier Nicolas Guilloteau, said “It’s a shame. Never before have I seen so much proof of corruption in one crime scene. A goddamn shame!”\n\nGustave Tissier, awaiting judgement, has been held in a cell at the police station of Bayonne. Once again, the police have done their job."
 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_1.1.A: "At least they are able to send thieves to jail..."

 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_1.2.t: "Stavisky Case Revealed"
 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_1.2.d: "Tissier wasn't the only one involved in the Ponzi Scheme. Dominique Garat, the Deputy Mayor, was arrested for receiving kickbacks from the Stavisky Scheme. When the folder arrived, Brigadier Nicolas Guilloteau was sitting at his desk. He realised right away that the days ahead would be extremely long.\n\nThe evidence establishes a link between Alexandre Stavisky, a well-known crook, and some government officials, including Gaston Bonnaure, senator René Renoult, and the minister of colonies, Albert Dalimier. Camille Chautemps' brother-in-law, attorney general Pressard, has been accused of delaying Stavisky's trial for months now over other matters, mostly scams, drug trafficking, and other falsifications.\n\n“Assistant Brigadier Martin, get me ten men, now!”\n\nAfter a quick debriefing, Nicolas and his team head in the direction of Stavisky's known address. Unfortunately, when they arrived, they discovered no trace of Alexandre Stavisky. The only thing they discovered was a photograph of him, which was most likely taken a few months ago. On the back of the photograph, two words, most likely his alias: Serge Alexandre. Without losing his cool, the young brigadier tends to Martin's photography:\n\n“Send this to the office, and launch a search warrant as fast as you can.”\n\n“Yes, Sir!”\n\nNicolas slowly concluded his inspection of Stavisky's room, having found no compromising clues. But was confident that the French Police will do their job as usual. He finally leaves to get a coffee after giving his men some instructions. If he is correct, he will require it within the next few days."
 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_1.2.A: "Thank God we caught the crook!"

 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_1.3.t: "Alexandre Stavisky is Found Dead!"
 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_1.3.d: "Stavisky, who has been missing for several days, appears to have sought refuge in Chamonix, a mountain tourist town. He appears to have remained hidden in a small cottage for the past two days.\n\nBrigadier Nicolas Guilloteau, accompanied by some local gendarmes, has quickly entered the cottage after being alerted by local police who recognise him after seeing his photography in Le Monde. They heard shots being fired upstairs a few seconds after the squad arrived. Alexandre Stavisky was on the floor, dying, with two bullets in his head when they found him.\n\nDespite prompt transportation to the nearest hospital, he died the following morning. The public's curiosity about whether it was a suicide or if the police killed him has grown rapidly. The headline in the newspaper Le Canard Enchainé read: "Stavisky commits suicide with a revolver shot fired at point-blank range."\n\nIn response to this uncertainty, the far-right leagues have slammed the Chautemps government, accusing it of corruption, Freemasonry, and even being manipulated by Jewish circles, claiming that Stavinsky was a Russian Jew. Jacques Durand, a Croix-de-Feu member from Paris, stated, "We did not fight in the Great War to see our country stink with theft and corruption”. The political upheaval it caused irritated some government collaborators, but Council President Camille Chautemps simply replied:"
 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_1.3.A: "Since when have conspiracy theorists been taken seriously?"

 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_2.1.t: "Rise of Tensions with the Leagues!"
 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_2.1.d: "Since Stavinsky's death, tensions with far-right leagues have escalated to levels that no one could have predicted. The event has been condemned by Action Française Camelots, Croix-de-Feu veterans, Jeunesses Patriotes bonapartists, and even the Françists of Marcel Bucard.\n\nIt was all because of Stavinsky's suspicious death! However, a few days later, monarchist Léon Daudet accused Chautemps of being behind the affair. Worse, the arrests of Mr. Aimar, editor of the "Liberté," and Mr. Dubarry, director of the "Volonté," both anti-parliamentary newspapers, have only heightened tensions.\n\nDespite deputy Jean Ybarnegaray's call to establish a commission of inquiry to investigate the situation, the violence has spread across the streets. Many soldiers, particularly veterans of the Great War, have recently joined colonel De la Rocques' Croix-de-Feu, demonstrating a high level of discontent in the army, and new memberships to more radical organisations, such as Maurras Action Française, have greatly increased in recent weeks, in a massive show of opposition to the government.\n\nWhat will the leagues do next as a result of the Chautemps government's inability to restore order? Only the future holds the answer."
 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_2.1.A: "Let the commission do its job."
 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_2.1.B: "All this is getting too big, we have to intervene!."

 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_2.2.t: "Demonstration in Paris"
 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_2.2.d: "Jacques Durand was one of many Frenchmen enraged by the government's inaction. He decided to join his fellow league members in protest against the corruption and constant over-ups as a supporter of the Croix-de-Feu and a veteran of the Great War.\n\nWhen he arrived at the staging area, the Avenue des Champs Elysées, he was pleasantly surprised by the sheer number of people who, like him, were disgusted with the establishment and wanted to express their displeasure with the current situation. He noticed a growing mob of students to his left, presumably Action Française supporters given their blue and yellow flags, but became concerned when he noticed a small, but ever-present, group of Parti Communiste supporters spewing vitriol. Despite being a staunch opponent of bolshevism, Jacque's concern faded as he realised that the communists were just as dissatisfied with the status quo as he was.\n\nHis thoughts were then interrupted by a sharp whistle and the sudden movement forward of the now massive horde of people. The march was on."
 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_2.2.A: "À bas les voleurs! Stavisky au Panthéon!"

 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_3.1.t: "Camille Chautemps Resigns"
 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_3.1.d: "Today, following the recent turn of events, the Council President, Camille Chautemps, has presented his resignation to the President, Albert Lebrun.\n\nHis young government, in place since November 1933, did not stand up to the ongoing crisis. Accusations of corruption, combined with his Freemasonry membership, did not help Chautemps maintain control of the situation. His departure, around noon, has had no immediate impact on the situation, but the leagues have reduced their charges against the government, which would otherwise be in the hands of corruption and masons.\n\nAfter Chautemps left, President Lebrun called Édouard Daladier and asked him to form a new government as soon as possible, which he gladly accepted. Daladier was already in the Bourbon Palace by the end of the day, calling for a return to order before the situation exploded completely.\n\nThe leagues continue to protest in the street, so now, one question is on everyone’s mind: will the situation finally clear up, or will it sink further into darkness?"
 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_3.1.A: "Can Daladier still save the Marianne’s Republic from herself?"

 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_3.3.t: "The Case of Jean Chiappe"
 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_3.3.d: "Jean Chiappe, the Prefect of Police in Paris, is a powerful man. Very powerful.\n\nHis prestigious position, combined with his numerous connections, particularly in monarchist circles, have all contributed to the development of his reputation.\n\nThe issue with this situation is that his level of power makes him an ideal target for a government whose majority of supporters are from left-wing parties. Someone in the government proposed removing him from his post and offering him a good retirement, preferably far from the capital, such as becoming a general resident in Morocco and being a French diplomat here.\n\nHowever, the Chiappe connections should not be overlooked: Maurice Pujo and Charles Maurras, both Action Française thinkers, are close to Jean Chiappe, not to mention his military contacts, such as Jean de Lattres de Tassigny and Philippe Leclerc de Hautecloque, both monarchists general. If we try to remove him from power, they will almost certainly react violently.\n\nIn a few days, the President of the Council, Édouard Daladier, will propose to Chiappe an agreement: leave the Police Prefecture in exchange for an equally prestigious position in Morocco. Or, if he views the Chiappe's relations as acceptable, he will stay, putting our alliance with the left in jeopardy. What will Daladier's decision be? That is the question of the 2000 francs."
 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_3.3.A: "Dismiss him!"
 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_3.3.B: "We can not risk to anger the leagues."

 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_3.4.t: "Call for Demonstration!"
 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_3.4.d: "Jacques had attended a meeting from the Croix-de-Feu, as he did every Saturday. What he hadn't expected was the presence of the CDF's leader, Colonel François De la Rocque. De la Rocque has called for a street demonstration of rightist leagues in protest of the "Chiappe Affaire" and the regime's overall corruption in a passionate speech.\n\nSurprisingly, the Colonel also declared a temporary alliance with other groups such as the monarchist Action Française, the Bonapartists Jeunesses Patriotes, and even the young Francist party led by Marcel Bucard.\nDespite ideological differences, all of the leagues' leaders came to the same logical conclusion: they need union against the government.\n\nJacques, despite his reservations about some of the party's ideas, agreed with his final call. A peaceful manifestation can't be all bad, right? But, with the alliance of this party, they have numbers on their side: hundreds of members from every right-wing party have already responded to the call for a march on Paris.\n\nJacques is confident: the friendship of the Croix-de-Feu and the league pact gave him hope for a better future. After a few hours of discussing the march's route, he and his friends leave the reunion, remembering De la Rocque's final words:"
 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_3.4.A: "Rendez-vous le 6 Février"

 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_3.5.t: "SFIO Leaves the Coalition!"
 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_3.5.d: "Following our decision not removing Jean Chiappe from power, we now face the consequences of our actions: the SFIO has left the coalition. Having joined us two years ago in what was called the “Cartel des gauches”, the SFIO was one of our main supporters before this day.\n\nThe breaking point came when Leon Blum, a prominent member of the party, left the government without speaking to the assembly before launching into a speech in front of the Bourbon Palace, denouncing the government for retaining corrupt officials. All of the party quickly followed him, and we are now alone in government, with less support that we couldn't afford to lose.\n\nTheir departure has been viewed as a risky move, as he may be viewed as a weakness of our government by rightist leagues, so we must quickly find another partner to join our coalition. Daladier has immediately called for calm, and he has officially announced that he will meet with Blum in a few days to try to persuade him to stay in his government. The question now is whether he will be successful, but all government politicians have agreed that Blum will most likely not return to Daladier. In reality, the Council President is making fun of himself."
 FRA_Stavisky_Case_Part_3.5.A: "Damn it Daladier!"

 FRA_Crisis_of_the_6_February.1.t: "The Leagues Manifest on the Champs-Élysées"
 FRA_Crisis_of_the_6_February.1.d: "The march had started quietly in the afternoon, Jacques had marched alongside other Croix-de-feu veterans on the Champs Élysée. However, this time it was different, instead of marching up the Champs to the Arc de Triomphe to rekindle the flame of the unknown soldier, the leagues marched down towards the Palais Bourbon where the investiture of Edouard Daladier was held.\n\nHowever, to the great misfortune of some, the bridge leading to the Parliament had been blocked by the Police in the morning and the Leagues found themselves blocked on the Place de la Concorde.\n\nTensions rose quickly as Jacques saw members of the JPs and other leagues begin to fight with members of the police. The crowd quickly dispersed across Paris where further brawls took place. Fortunately for Jacques, he had managed to make his way to the Esplanade des Invalides, on the other side of the Seine, where other members of the Croix-de-Feux and De la Rocque had gathered.\n\nThe sun had just set, Jacques could see carcasses of cars burning on the other side of the Seine, as well as a few Françistes fighting policemen with crowbars. Such a spectacle only brought back to him a period he wished would never emerge again. The atmosphere was becoming heavy, brief information had reached the ears of the group, Taittinger and Maurras would have taken over the town hall and installed a provisional government, nothing that would presage anything good in short. Jacques wondered what De la Rocque was going to do. The entrance to the Palais Bourbon was almost deserted, the police occupied by the demonstrators. Would the colonel be satisfied with this show of force and leave, choosing a more democratic option, or would he try something more dramatic and enter the parliament. He then saw him look at his watch and turn around."

Even if the damages are less severe than they could have been, the political consequences are catastrophic, necessitating firm but adequate decisions.\n\nRecognizing the possibility of being accused of favouring the Police Prefect, Jean Chiappe, [This.GetLeader] presented his resignation to President Albert Lebrun today, who accepted it immediately, saying that "one more or less Council President in a month should not really make a difference."\n\nFollowing his departure, [This.GetLeader] invited Gaston Doumergue to form a new government, which the former President accepted.

The fight was clearly unequal, as there were as many protesters as there were armed to the teeth.\n\nEnraged by the presence of the police, many men in the ranks have begun to destroy whatever they can. They probably thought that doing so would allow them to mimic the methods of the Nazis in the beginning. As many people witnessed last night, it was a blatant failure.\n\nIn the middle of the evening, after hours of demonstrations and violence, one of the Camelots du Roi got too close to a policeman. In reaction, he shot him. After this, the violence quickly escalated, and gunshots were distributed to every rioter who came too close to them. Even Jacques has received one, right in the knee. Screaming in pain, he barely walks to the nearest clinic, where he buys a vial of morphine to silence the pain. After minutes of hesitation, he decided to go back home. If someone wants to arrest him, let them try.

Shockingly, the damages are enormous, even by city standards.

The Radical Republican, who is ostensibly the only figure acceptable to both the far-right leagues and the centrist parliamentary parties, formed a new government dubbed the "National Unity government."\n\nWith the exception of the Socialist and Communist parties, it is a government that represents all political traditions. It includes several members of the centre-left, the Radical-Socialist and similar smaller parties, as well as War Minister Philippe Pétain and the most powerful members of the parliamentary right wing, including Radical Louis Barthou and social-Catholic Louis Marin.

 FRA_Events.42.t: "Communist Manifestations Repressed"
 FRA_Events.42.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Following the crisis of February 6, the PCF planned numerous demonstrations. One of which was at the Place de la Concorde. Hundreds of people showed up mostly unarmed with signs calling for the removal of Doumergue and PCF flags. This was not taken lightly by the newly empowered Doumergue as he has ordered a shutdown of these manifestations, insisting that he will use "Brutal Force like none of you have ever seen." \n\nThe demonstrators refused this ultimatum, resulting in Doumergue sending columns of police units and mounted police armed with batons down the Champs-Élysées to the demonstrations held at the Place de la Concorde. Violence ensued as protesters refused to leave, resulting in brawls and charges by police mounted on horseback, causing the death of 9 demonstrators and countless injuries."

We have several options, but we must choose wisely because this decision will determine the direction of our government, and thus the country.\n\nThe first option would be to form a "Old Guard'' government made up of Doumerge supporters and political parties. This, however, may enrage the other parties and some members of the public, leaving us with no allies and only a few people in government.\n\nThe second option is to form a larger coalition with more parties and individuals, which would increase our public popularity. They would, however, be less loyal and would, if necessary, oppose Doumerge and his policies.\n\nThere is technically a third option, though no one recommends it: A massive coalition with the Workers' International's French Section, led by Pierre Renaudel.

The reform of the voting system bears witness to the fatal governmental hesitations in the spring of 1934. The Frossard proposal is being debated in the Chamber right now. The bill appears to be doomed at the moment, which is why Paul Reynaud urged the government to fulfil its role of directing legislative work and to be an actor in electoral reform rather than a passive observer.\n\nThe bill's supporters argue that it would be the first step toward state reform. According to them, refusing proportional representation makes any organic reform of the state, any revitalization of the regime, impossible; it is intentionally opting for a dangerous and fatally uncertain status quo. Because electoral reform is the prerequisite for all other reforms, it has the potential to save the regime, because the regime can only save itself through reform.\n\nOpponents of the bill, on the other hand, point to the so-called "republican tradition," which states that the government should not intervene in electoral matters. The Chamber has an undeniable right to take the lead in this matter. It has previously used it freely and without interference from the government."
 FRA_Reform_of_the_State.3.A: "This is the first step to greater reform, support the bill."
 FRA_Reform_of_the_State.3.B: "\"Republican tradition\" requires us not to take sides"

 FRA_Reform_of_the_State.4.t: "The Senate refuses to dissolve the Parliament"
 FRA_Reform_of_the_State.4.d: "Following the recent far-right riots and political upheaval, it was evident that action was needed to keep the Third Republic intact. With right-wing extremists undermining democracy and governments falling like raindrops in a thunderstorm, it became evident that dramatic reform was required to maintain liberty and prevent the French Republic from being destroyed.\n\nPresident Gaston Doumergue proposed that the President be given more authority and autonomy from the Chamber of Deputies, claiming that no reform would be feasible unless the President was stronger. While most members of the National Union Government's unstable coalition initially embraced this notion, it appears that support for it has diminished over time. A few weeks, it became evident that his policies were losing support within his own cabinet as well as in parliament.\n\nFaced with this change of events, as well as growing left-wing resistance to the reform, President Doumergue submitted a resolution to dissolve Parliament, acknowledging that he had little alternative but to use his constitutional powers. We expected the Senate to fully support us in this situation. Who could, after all, ignore the massive political instability within the Government?\n\nHowever, this was not to be. In an astonishingly foolish decision, the French Senate has decided to reject this resolution outright. They have concluded that this decaying Parliament must continue within the disintegrating framework of the Third Republic. This change of events has made reform attempts considerably more difficult, if not impossible. If we are to see this reform implemented peacefully, a compromise with Parliament and support from our own government appear to be essential."
 FRA_Reform_of_the_State.4.A: "Fools! There was no other way!"

 FRA_Reform_of_the_State.5.t: "The Senate accepts to dissolve the Parliament"
 FRA_Reform_of_the_State.5.d: "The path to political reform now lies wide open.\n\nPresident Doumergue was nervous and tense as Parliamentary support for his reform bill fell precipitously. With the increasing fervour of the left's opposition to it, and with many members of his own government opposing the bill, he was concerned about the bill's and the country's future.\n\n'What are we to do if reform fails? What will save the nation then?', he wondered. He decided he had to do everything he could to make it happen, even if it meant dissolving Parliament and replacing every single member.\n\nHis fears, however, have been allayed, as the Senate has approved his motion to dissolve Parliament. While it is unclear why a majority of Senate members would support this motion, the recent political turmoil is certain to have played a role, and rumours of impending extremist riots may have also contributed. Whatever the case, Parliament is effectively dead, and President Doumergue now has a chance to pass his bill."
 FRA_Reform_of_the_State.5.A: "Now we can get to work on fixing this country."

 FRA_Reform_of_the_State.6.t: "The National Republicans attack Herriot and the Radicaux!"
 FRA_Reform_of_the_State.6.d: "Even as members of a ruling coalition, it appears that our allies are unable to put aside their differences and work together.\n\nSince we allied with Herriot and the Radical Party, they have been complaining about the National Republican Propaganda Centre's harsh propaganda attacks on them. This includes, but is not limited to, caricatures, cartoons, and comics mocking the radical left's worldview, as well as personal attacks on Herriot.\n\nThese attacks were expected to stop once the National Republicans joined our coalition and found common ground. However, it soon became clear that having these two adversaries in the same coalition only served to further destabilise it.\n\nThe NRPC has launched yet another massive propaganda campaign against Herriot and the Radicaux. The National Republicans were harsh in their criticism, focusing on the Radical Left's finances, Camille Chautemps, and, once again, Herriot himself. This campaign has undoubtedly harmed the Radicaux brand and instilled hatred among our coalition members.\n\nWhile Herriot claims that this was the final straw and that action must now be taken against the NRPC, others argue that doing so would be considered an infringement of the public's free press rights. In any case, this will undoubtedly further sever this coalition.\n\nThe decision remains to be made."
 FRA_Reform_of_the_State.6.A: "Herriot is right. These attacks must stop."
 FRA_Reform_of_the_State.6.B: "Herriot will have to learn to handle criticism."

 FRA_Reform_of_the_State.7.t: "The Reform of the Century"
 FRA_Reform_of_the_State.7.d: "France, and perhaps the rest of the world, appears to be holding its breath in anticipation of the outcome of this day.\n\nPresident Gaston Doumergue has presented his reform bill to the National Assembly. It contains provisions to limit the power of the Chamber of Deputies, a provision to provide job security to civil servants, and an amendment to give the President greater control over the national budget. This is without a doubt one of the most important bills in recent French politics. Some might even call it "the Reform of the Century."\n\nHowever, debate in Parliament has erupted over whether the reform is for the people or for the President. Some claim that the President has granted himself powers that no world leader should have, saying that the Chamber of Deputies' authority should not be harmed in this way. Others argue that providing job security to civil servants would put an undue strain on the French economy.\n\nThe supporters of Doumergue, on the other hand, are vehemently opposed to all of this. Their argument is straightforward: France requires reform, and this is it. They argue that these changes are necessary in order for the Third Republic to survive in this time of global uncertainty, and France cannot afford to lose sight of its core values. They also claim that these changes will assist France in its recovery from the Great Depression and restoring peace and prosperity to the people.\n\nThe decision must be made now. This reform bill is unquestionably audacious and significant. The only question is whether it is a significant step forward."

 FRA_Assassination_of_Alexander_I.1.d: "King Alexander I of Yugoslavia, one of the most influential proponents of France's \"Little Entente,\" arrived in the beautiful Mediterranean French city of Marseille to sign an even more binding Franco-Yugoslav agreement, further tying the two nations together. There to greet his royal highness's arrival was French Foreign Minister Louis Barthou and a large and pompous escort. As the duo slowly drove through the streets of the ancient city, throngs of adoring citizens blanketed the route, hoping to catch a glimpse of living royalty with their own eyes.\n\nSuddenly, out of the crowd, a man dashed at the car. The man leapt up onto the running board of the car and, to the great relief of those in the car, waved around a bouquet of flowers chanting \"Vive le roi!\" However, that relief was soon extinguished as the man revealed the Mauser C96 semi-automatic pistol he had been hiding in the flowers.

 FRA_Assassination_of_Alexander_I.5.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Bleak news from France today as both the King of Yugoslavia, Alexander I, and French Foreign Minister, Louis Barthou, have been assassinated by a renegade Bulgarian terrorist.\n\nWhile driving through the streets of Marseille, the infamous Bulgarian assassin Vlado Chernozemski opened fire on the passing motorcade carrying both Alexander and Louis. Alexander was shot twice, killing him within minutes, while Louis was shot by a French policeman amidst the chaos, severing a vital artery in his arm, leading to his death by blood loss. During his attempted escape, the assassin was brutally beaten by an enraged crowd.\n\nThe assassination came after failed French attempts to secure both Italy and Yugoslavia into a continental bloc (including other Balkan nations, the Soviet Union and the Baltic states) due to territorial disputes along the Dalmatian coast. Two terrorist organisations responsible for this, the Ustaše and IMRO are indirectly supported by Italy, raising suspicions of Italian involvement.\n\nThe future remains uncertain; the assassination of Louis Barthou and King Alexander has effectively ended all French efforts in the Balkans, while only emboldening the nationalist front as it awaits the regency of the young new King, Peter II."

Many people, both civilians and politicians alike have come to honour Barthou, paying their respects to a major player in French politics. A member of the Alliance Démocratique, he held the prestigious post of Prime Minister in 1913, and oversaw major changes to our nation's social policy, including the introduction of allowances to families with children.\n\nAs well as serving as Prime Minister, he has also served as the Foreign Minister before his unfortunate death, with many agreeing that Barthou's greatest diplomatic achievement was the improvement of Franco-Soviet relations. He is largely responsible for the Soviet Union's admission to the League of Nations, and prior to his death, he was involved in efforts to establish an "Eastern Pact," which would have included Germany, the Soviet Union, Poland, the Baltic States, and Czechoslovakia. The goal of this was to maintain peace and settle border disputes between the Soviets and Germans, but this is unlikely to come to fruition now.\n\nThousands are in attendance at Barthou's funeral, and many have expressed great sadness at the atrocity. Members of the Paris art community have also come to pay their respects to Barthou, who was a patron and an ardent supporter of the arts, with one bystander expressing her shock at the horrible manner in which Barthou died.\n\nThe current Minister of Security, Albert Sarraut, has resigned in shame, stating that better security measures should’ve been put in place, and that it was his fault for overlooking such a great detail."

 FRA_1936_Election.1.t: "SFIO and PCF Protest against the Fascists!"
 FRA_1936_Election.1.d: "Paris is in uproar again, less than a week after Daladier's resignation, with thousands of people taking to the streets, and police officers are desperately trying to keep the peace. However, the crowds are not the same as they were a few days ago, as red banners and three-arrow flags flail in the wind outside the Chamber of Deputies. Anarchists, communists, and socialists have joined forces in a massive protest in Paris, united in their opposition to the fascist leagues that had rallied there just days before, and general strikes are being called by labour unions. Communists and socialists are more united than ever in their opposition to fascism.\n\nMany protesters were seen holding signs calling for leftist unity and chanting anti-fascist slogans, with some even throwing rocks at alleged pro-fascist officials and bystanders, referring to them as brownshirts and thugs. A large group of protestors began singing L'Internationale on one occasion.\n\nMany on the left see these counter protests as noble, but they are not without violence: nine people have been killed in clashes with police so far. Since the Stavisky affair, the mood in the country has become increasingly polarised, but tensions have boiled over in the last week. Some people even believe that civil war or another revolution is a real possibility."

 FRA_1936_Election.2.d: "In the aftermath of the February 6th crisis, Maurice Thorez, the leader of the Parti Communiste Français, issued a call for unity to all left-wing parties and organisations. The French left is notoriously divided between various factions, but Thorez hopes to change that.\n\nThere have long been efforts and desires in France to unite the left, particularly since the country was hit by the Great Depression several years ago. With the rise of right-wing authoritarian governments in Austria, Italy, and, most recently, Germany, many Frenchmen on the left are becoming increasingly concerned that their own country will descend into fascism. The February 6th riots appear to have been the final straw, as support for a coalition of leftist parties has since risen. If Léon Blum agrees, the SFIO and PCF will likely merge in the coming weeks."

The Front Populaire currently controls slightly more than a third of the national assembly, but various other left-wing and liberal parties are considering joining.

Algerian integration could potentially weaken the colony's opposition.\n\nFurthermore, the colony has been a part of the republic for so long that many people now consider Algeria to be a part of the French mainland, so integrating the colony makes perfect sense."

Despite numerous attempts by the police to dislodge and control the strikes, the strikes have spread uncontrollably throughout the city and then rapidly to the city of Toulouse, and many workers have begun to occupy the factories in which they work. In just two days, striking workers occupied numerous factories in Toulouse, handing the police a major defeat.\n\nWorse, the strikes have spread to neighbouring cities, and some female workers, particularly in textile and food manufacturing plants, have mobilised and led strikes.\n\nThe situation is dire, and if nothing is done to halt the strikes, they will spread even further across France, causing even more devastation."
 FRA_Pre_Matignon_Accord.1.A: "For God’s sake just calm down!"

 FRA_Pre_Matignon_Accord.2.t: "Strikes all across France"
 FRA_Pre_Matignon_Accord.2.d: "The Great Depression hit our country hard, with not only high unemployment but also high inflation. As a result, we have been unable to pay our numerous labourers enough to keep up with rising inflation, and as a result, a series of strikes are taking place on a regular basis.\n\nHow we deal with these strikes is constantly being debated within our own government, but the main consensus is that in order to alleviate the problem, we must practise austerity and tighten our belts in the face of our trade, particularly within our colonies. Lest we think that keeping the gold standard despite the rest of the West will benefit us in the long run."
 FRA_Pre_Matignon_Accord.2.A: "May God save the Red, White, and Blue"

 FRA_Pre_Matignon_Accord.3.t: "[This.GetLeader] Addresses the French People"
 FRA_Pre_Matignon_Accord.3.d: "With the impending crisis, the depression still raging, and agitation from political opponents on all sides, [This.Getleader] has been drafting a speech in order to relieve the populace and quell the anger that still exists in the nation. His tenure as president since 1932 has been stressful for him, with long sessions of sitting in his room and having restless nights trying to get everything in order, with just the mere thought of giving the speech eating away at him.\n\nHowever, it would be drafted, his different documents checked and revised as needed, and it was time to deal with and confront the difficulties that faced the nation daily, as well as satiate the requirements of opposition when reasonable. The reputation of this country and its stability must be protected to the greatest extent possible, and what was just finalised will be delivered to the public by the president himself and will hopefully alleviate the situation."
 FRA_Pre_Matignon_Accord.3.A: "To those living under our flag..."

 FRA_Matignon_Accord.1.t: "The Matignon Accords"
 FRA_Matignon_Accord.1.d: "The massive general strike that destroyed our economy is over. We have signed an agreement with the unions and the workers they represent to introduce a plethora of legislation aiming to augment the rights of workers. Among these concessions were the legal right to strike, the removal of all obstacles to union organization, and a blanket 7-12 percent wage increase for all workers. Although this agreement has fulfilled the demands of the strikers and will end the strikes, it has brought much criticism from the right, who insist that the government should have been much harsher in dealing with the strike and crushed those who refused to work. We have done what we promised in our campaign run, but the rightists may have a point; inflation is skyrocketing and we may have made the economy worse as it struggles to adapt to these sudden changes."
 FRA_Matignon_Accord.1.A: "It will get worse before it gets better... Right?"

With Darlan's doctrine, our ships, with strengthened hulls and impressive guns, can leave port knowing that they will be the might of the seas,  while our enemies will be forced to put up massive efforts to counter our fleet, which could be beyond their capabilities.\n\nWhile staying in port, our fleet will keep growing, to a point where enemies will be forced to keep up their own naval forces if they are to stand any chance against our "fleet in being". Darlan wants to create a navy like this for this reason: to project our power across the waters."

So far, our British ambassador has written a letter requesting our friend across the channel to help with naval research. Their fleet is one of the largest in the world, and any support from them will be greatly appreciated. We could, on the other hand, continue to develop French Naval technology and achieve our own advances. In either case, the quality of our fleet will considerably improve. What are your thoughts?"

 FRA_Colonies.2.t: "The Black Gold of Algeria"
 FRA_Colonies.2.d: "After extensive investigation, our specialists mostly concur that Algeria has natural oil. This oil would be a very significant strategic resource if we were to obtain it. It can be refined into fuel, which will not only be helpful in keeping the lights on at home, but can also be used to keep the army moving, with tanks, trucks, and planes all needing it to run properly.\n\nTherefore, we must locate the oil precisely in Algeria and build up the necessary machinery to extract it. Of course, there is a lot to accomplish and this is no simple task. Finding the black gold's whereabouts is currently of the utmost importance since without it, nothing can be accomplished.\n\nBut since time does not wait for anybody, it is imperative that this resource, which we refer to as black gold, needs to be extracted fast, otherwise our fuel tanks will run dry and the nation will grind to a halt! Being delicate and completing the task quickly are both challenges in our way, but no challenge is too big for the might of French engineering!"
 FRA_Colonies.2.A: "We hope to find it soon."
 
 FRA_Colonies.3.t: "Oil Found in Algeria!"
 FRA_Colonies.3.d: "We eventually located the oil after a protracted search, and as the drill sunk, a dark liquid rushed out. Everyone in the room was overjoyed to learn that their long days of labour had not gone to waste.\n\nWe have been looking so hard for the oil, for black gold! Now that we have this strategic resource, we will be able to bring in the necessary equipment to begin extracting it in large quantities. Of course, we must safeguard this resource, otherwise the entire world will be clamouring to get to it faster than us.\n\nBeyond the heat and sand, I had no clue that there was so much to research about this continent of Africa. So much potential, so many resources, all waiting for us to find them."
 FRA_Colonies.3.A: "Nous sommes riches!"

 FRA_Colonies.8.t: "The Viénot Agreement"
 FRA_Colonies.8.d: "Today in Paris, the Viénot Accords have been signed between us and the Syrian delegation, heralding a new age in our rule of the nation. While it has not been an easy process, the accords satisfy both sides, with neither feeling as though they have lost too much from it.\n\nAmong some of the agreements, major ones include: the Syrian National Bloc becoming the only legitimate representative of the Syrian people, with the ultimate goal being Syrian independence.\n\nIn terms of land and ethnic groups, Alawite and Druze will be part of a new Syrian state,  with both previously enjoying independence. Lebanon will not be included however, although the Syrian delegation did not seem too bothered about this.\n\nThe agreement also calls for reducing the number of French troops and bases in Syria, as well as an end to French interference in Syria's internal affairs.\n\nIn return, Syria has agreed to grant us extra military production use on its soil, as well as closer military cooperation between our two nations, which will allow us access to its airspace. There were also other political, economic, and cultural provisions in the accords, but they were less important than these major details."
 FRA_Colonies.8.A: "A toast, to Syria and France!"

 FRA_Colonies.9.t: "Syria Shall be Independent...Eventually"
 FRA_Colonies.9.d: "For two months, strikes in Syria have left the nation completely paralyzed, crippling the economy and making our rule seem unjustifiable with the state that it is in. It has left us no choice but to come to the table and engage in negotiations with the Syrian National Bloc, with the pressure on us reaching a breaking point.\n\nAfter much debate and deliberation, we have come to an agreement over the next steps Syria shall take, all culminating in the Viénot Accords. The agreement states that Syria will become an independent nation and that the Syrian National Bloc is the sole genuine voice of the Syrian people. However, this will not happen immediately, and it will take some before the colonial administration has fully wound down. In the meanwhile, we'll cooperate and strive for a peaceful development, as it is in the best interests of both our nations.\n\nRegardless of the past, we shall go ahead together united. "
 FRA_Colonies.9.A: "Our civilizing mission is almost done."

 FRA_Colonies.10.t: "The Viénot Failure"
 FRA_Colonies.10.d: "According to information telegraphed to us from our delegation in Paris, the French and Syrian parties have not signed any agreements. Although our diplomats negotiated with the Syrian side, all of our reasonable ideas were rejected.\n\nThey support the creation of a totally autonomous Syrian state that would not need to support other countries during a war, saving them from any international entanglements. Additionally, our suggestion that Syria can assist France in the future was rejected, which we were most furious about after the amount of progress that we have made in the region, especially in the areas that are most important to the Syrian economy.\n\nAs a result of this, there was no progress in our conversations, and some have even felt that we have gone backwards! The report stated that it was "an awkward set of circumstances, with both sides visibly uncomfortable at any suggestions that were made”. The Viénot Accords have ended up in a complete failure, and we will have to go back to the drawing board if we are to keep the Syrians in line with us."

 FRA_Colonies.12.A: "A tragedy."

 FRA_Colonies.13.t: "Nominate a New General-Governor"
 FRA_Colonies.13.d: "It is once again time to name a new General-Governor for our French Indochina territories. This time, two men stand out as clear favourites.\n\nThe first is Albert-Pierre Sarraut, a radical politician known for his pro-colonialist stance. He is a supporter of liberal reforms and native cooperation, and is best known for his "Franco-Annamese Collaboration" policy as General-Governor of French Indochina during one of his previous tenures. Many, however, criticise Albert for caving in to native demands, thereby jeopardising French control of the region.\n\nThe second and more popular choice is Eugène Jean Louis René Robin, a former General-Governor of French Indochina. His views on colonial policies are diametrically opposed to Albert's, with him advocating for strict Law and Order and asserting total French control over the region. More liberal politicians, on the other hand, frequently criticise him for being too harsh and authoritarian.\n\nBoth men are qualified for the position, and the decision we make will determine our colonial policy in the region."
 FRA_Colonies.13.A: "René Robin, for Law and Order"

Having both served in the Great War, as well as both being the Chief of Staff in their respective countries, the two met to discuss a range of topics, some of which we had wanted to bring up with the Italians, such as closer military cooperation, as well as discussions on the latest military technology.\n\nWhile our ideologies may differ between our two nations, it is still important to maintain both military and diplomatic ties with them in the hopes that peace in Europe can be preserved, as the threat of a fascist bloc forming on the continent is unnervingly high. Trying to keep the Italians on side with what we would like to see in Europe is no easy task to achieve, but keeping lines of communication open between our two armies might just help in the task of preserving an eternal piece."

 FRA_Sino_Japanese_War_Chinese_Defeat.1.t: "Long Yun seeks our Protection"
 FRA_Sino_Japanese_War_Chinese_Defeat.1.d: "When the Empire of Japan declared war on the Republic of China a few weeks ago, the Chinese people and warlords declared their support for the Republic and their intention to fight the Japanese invaders. That was before the Japanese dealt a crushing blow to the Republic forces. With their superior military and excellent tactics, they had inflicted defeat after defeat on the Chinese forces. The frontlines would not hold, no matter how patriotic the Chinese soldiers were, and the Republic would capitulate.\n\nIn light of these events, we've received an intriguing request from Long Yun, Yunnan's warlord. Recognizing that our help was the only way out of this situation, he has asked for French protection for his province.\n\nEssentially, he expects us to take over the security of the region. He stated in his request telegram that he "expected French intervention to help stave off Japanese expansion" and that "the people of Yunnan would be more than willing to remain under those who have brought our Indochinese brothers into an era of prosperity over the years."\n\nDisagreements about our response are brewing in government halls. Some are eager to accept because it would greatly expand our influence in China and strengthen our position in Indochina, arguing that it has never been easier to expand our sphere of influence. Others, on the other hand, urge caution. Japan, the very force Yunnan seeks to protect itself from, is not known for its pragmatism or diplomatic softness. If the Japanese perceive our presence in Yunnan as a threat to their conquest of China, war may be considered.\n\nThe question that remains: Is Yunnan worth a war with Japan?"

#Armistice

 FRA_Capitulation_of_France.1.t: "Defeat"
 FRA_Capitulation_of_France.1.d: "The battle is lost. Paris has fallen into German hands, and it is only a matter of time before the rest of the country is occupied. We must now think to the future. Elements within the government want an armistice with Germany, but many officers wish to continue the struggle from Britain.\n\nCertain members of the British War Cabinet have suggested another option - a merger of France and Great Britain into a single nation, which will fight on until all of France has been liberated."
 FRA_Capitulation_of_France.1.A: "We must collaborate with the Germans."
 FRA_Capitulation_of_France.1.B: "The fight goes on!"

 FRA_Capitulation_of_France.2.d: "Our victory in France is nearly complete. The French government has asked for an armistice, and our diplomats have prepared terms which they have agreed to. They will retain control of southern France, while we are free to occupy the rest."
 FRA_Capitulation_of_France.2.A: "Establish Vichy France."
 FRA_Capitulation_of_France.2.B: "No, Germany will conquer all!"

 FRA_Capitulation_of_France.3.t: "The Second Armistice at Compiègne"
 FRA_Capitulation_of_France.3.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]An armistice between the [From.GetName] and the French Third Republic has been signed at Compiègne, in the very railway carriage in which the German surrender in World War I was negotiated.\n\nUnder the terms of the armistice, a French government under [vichy_france.GetLeader] based out of Vichy will continue to administer most of southern France, while the rest of the country falls under a German Occupation Zone. \n\nSome French officers have vowed to continue resistance from abroad, but this puts an effective end to the fighting in France, at least for the time being."
 FRA_Capitulation_of_France.3.A: "Disturbing"
 FRA_Capitulation_of_France.3.B: "Excellent!"
 FRA_Capitulation_of_France.3.C: "The fight continues!"

 FRA_Capitulation_of_France.4.t: "Germany Refuses Armistice!"
 FRA_Capitulation_of_France.4.d: "The shadow of occupation looms over France.\n\nThanks to their stunning advances and decisive victories on the battlefield, the Germans have arrived at the gates of Paris. Faced with the impossibility of a military victory over the Germans and immense political turmoil, it was decided to seek peace with the Germans. They had made no secret of their intention to seek retaliation for the Treaty of Versailles. We were willing to accept humiliating terms in order to achieve peace and relieve the burdens of war on our people. However, our hopes appear to have been dashed.\n\nIn an astonishing display of ruthlessness and hatred, the Germans have rejected our request for an armistice. In response to our proposal, the German High Command stated that "a complete military victory over the French was required to wash away the stains of the humiliation imposed on Germany at the end of the Great War," and that "the German people believe that the French must be brought to their knees by the Reich's mighty war machine."\n\nAs a result of this derogatory response, the government has become even more polarised. While everyone recognises that France's freedom and survival are at stake, their solutions differ. Some argue that we should immediately surrender our arms and allow France to be completely occupied. They argue that by doing so, the Germans will at the very least demonstrate their respect and friendship for the French people. Others argue that this occupation will be hell on Earth for our people and that the only way to end it is to fight until the end.\n\nOne thing is certain, however: the Germans have defeated us. The only question now is how badly they have done so."
 FRA_Capitulation_of_France.4.A: "May God help us all..."

 FRA_Question_of_Hatay.1.t: "Turkey is asking for Hatay"
 FRA_Question_of_Hatay.1.d: "The leaders of the nation of Turkey have approached us. They propose that the province of Hatay, in the northern-most point of Syria should have a referendum about staying in our great Syrian colony or becoming a state in their Republic. It was inhabited by ethnic Turks who left after the successful war of independence. Although many left for a better life, some people still remain, having lived here for generations. This does make it a good target for their leaders, it hasn't got any strategic value and it may convince them to join the War."

 FRA_Events.1.t: "Finishing up the Maginot Line"
 FRA_Events.1.d: "We are almost completely done with the construction of the Maginot line but the military is split on their priorities, Armée de l'Air clam the Luftwaffe should be our main concern. They will most likely be just as effective over the french skies. All the while the Armée de Terre claim the Heer is our primary concern. The German's Panzers will smash us to bits if we do not prepare for them and make sure our forts are up to date."

 FRA_Events.2.t: "1936 Legislative Elections"
 FRA_Events.2.d: "It's the 1936 French legislative elections, one that is sure to be remembered. The current state of France, both social and economically has polarised politics. Socialists and the PCF wish to safeguard workers rights, paving a way for a revolution. The far-right leagues remain a powerful opposition despite attempts at keeping them down. The centre is stunned, while republicans and the moderated right is desperately trying to garner support. Whatever the results, the next government will have a big role in bringing The Republic back on its feet."
 FRA_Events.2.A: "Léon Blum - Popular Front"
 FRA_Events.2.B: "Pierre-Étienne Flandin - Droite Parlementaire"
 FRA_Events.2.C: "Louis Marin - Droite Parlementaire"

 FRA_Events.3.t: "General Strike"
 FRA_Events.3.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The victory of the Popular Front in the 1936 elections has provoked a massive strike. Workers have stopped working in practically every factory, efficiency and production have been slashed in half, and some laborers have taken it upon themselves to take their workplaces hostage. They are certain they will get what they want from the Popular Front, who was elected by them and ran on a platform of expanded rights for workers. Although we are being exploited, they are right. We must reach an agreement, and quickly. Every possible concession must be made to get our economy back on its feet, because if these strikes continue, it may remain crippled for years. The world is leaning once more towards war; we cannot afford to waste time and production."
 FRA_Events.3.A: "It keeps going from worse to worse."

 FRA_Events.4.t: "General Strike"
 FRA_Events.4.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]With the Republican Coalition's government well established for the time being, numerous union leaders, as well s the PCF leadership, have called for a massive strike across Metropolitan France. They demand that \"The rights of the French workforce are upheld by the state, and that no compromise be made with the 'bourgeois coalition.'\" Production has been halved and the already unstable republic wavers yet again. The Prime Minister has yet to release any official statements."
 FRA_Events.4.A: "Just what we needed..."

 FRA_Events.5.t: "Anti-Republican Strikes Grow"
 FRA_Events.5.d: "The Anti-Republican general strike has reached its peak! The disease has spread across all of France, as more and more workers have joined their cause, those who don't are blocked from entering the factories by the legions of strikers that occupy them. France has stopped working, production-wise, our cabinet has entered complete chaos and the calls for action by the middle and upper classes have become impossible to ignore. Something must be done, immediately!"
 FRA_Events.5.A: "They will never have enough, will they?"

 FRA_Events.6.t: "More Strikes!"
 FRA_Events.6.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The general strike has expanded! Following the example of their cohorts, more and more workers across France have laid down their tools to protest their conditions and demand expanded rights. Before, production levels were brought low, but we were still functioning. However, with this expansion, our entire economy has stagnated. This means our construction projects have halted, our factories can no longer produce, and no more guns are being made. We've got to reach an agreement no matter the cost. French industry won't survive much longer on the global market without it."
 FRA_Events.6.A: "Damn Strikes! Why can't they just be happy with what they have?"

 FRA_Events.7.t: "Matignon Compromise is signed!"
 FRA_Events.7.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The Anti-Republican strike has come to an end. The damage to our economy has yet to be accounted for, and the French citizen's views on the state has been somewhat tarnished, nevertheless, through careful coordination between our cabinet, factory owners and union leaders, we have managed to bring the country back from the verge of revolution. Both sides had to give up some of their demands, and it's unlikely they will remember us fondly for it, but an accord has been made, and things can go back to the way they were."
 FRA_Events.7.A: "See? Everyone's happy. Now get back to work..."

 FRA_Events.9.t: "Maurice Thorez calls for an end of all Strikes"
 FRA_Events.9.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]“One must know how to finish a strike, at the moment that the main points have been obtained.”\n Maurice Thorez, the leader of the Communist Party, has called for an end to the strikes that we have had such problems in dealing with. Slowly, across the country, men and women return to work, having obtained what they wanted. The Matignon Agreements have given them many new rights, and, soon, our economy will get back on its feet. However, our problems are not over. Factories are reporting struggles in adapting to the changes, workers still doubt our ability to restrain factory bosses, and the Popular Front is fracturing. Our problems have only begun."
 FRA_Events.9.A: "At long last, the strikes are over."

 FRA_Events.10.t: "French Popular Party founded"
 FRA_Events.10.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Jacques Doriot, a once-avid communist who was expelled from his own party after advocating the formation of a Popular Front with the less-radical Socialist Party, has struck back at his party. After shifting towards a more \"national\" socialist viewpoint, Doriot decided to establish a new party whose agenda is more in line with that of Nazi Germany. The new Parti Populaire Français may be easily confused with the Popular Front, but the two could not be more different. The new party calls Saint-Denis its home and, after the banning of fascist groups, extremists such as the Action Française and Croix-de-Feu are flocking to its banner. This does not bode well for France. We cannot have radicals tearing apart our internal stability as we faces threats abroad."

His writings as a historian and journalist reveal a man disgusted with the direction of France in the past centuries, and he recruited many angry young souls to join him in the militant, fascist Action Française. However, he is most known for his writings on the Treaty of Versailles. He attacked the document that brought us peace, labeling it as \"too harsh in its mild features, too mild in its harsh features,\" believing that the treaty would provoke the German people to seek revenge while not stopping them from taking it. His burial shall take place in two days, but we have learned that he was denied the last rites by Cardinal Jean Verdier since the Pope condemned the Action Française. Many in our government are glad to see the man gone, but his death may stir up trouble with the far right…"

 FRA_Events.12.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Léon Blum, the head of the Socialist Party, has been brutally attacked! As the moderate leftist departed the National Assembly, having his taxicab cross the funeral procession of Jacques Bainville, he was set upon by far-right militants known as the King's Camelot and cut around the head. They were inspired by the rightist journalist Charles Maurras, who called for “the knife” to be used against politicians who supported the recent League of Nations sanctions against Italy earlier in the day. While active and devoted, the youth organization is looked down upon by other fascist groups for its violent tactics and its tendency to become involved in street brawls with leftist organizations and competitors among the right. This event will hopefully direct public opinion away from the right, but in the meantime, the president has declared its dissolution, along with its parent organization, the Action Française. However, this may rile up both the left and the right..."

They will travel around the country to arrive at the border, where they are supposed to stop another attack on the Benelux from the Jerry's. We hope that this will not develop in another 4 years of trench warfare and that we will stop this horrible ideology, making sure that Europe will not fall to it. We will kick the Nazi bastards up the rear end, tally ho!"
 FRA_Events.13.A: "Let's hope for the best..."

 FRA_Events.14.t: "Leftist Organizations Protest!"
 FRA_Events.14.d: "It is just as we expected. Léon Blum's beating has enraged the left, who are protesting our feeble crackdown on the far-right. However, much we might want to, harsh retaliation would only make the situation worse by giving the right a reason to, potentially, revolt. The last thing we need is a civil war, so we need to focus our efforts on calming both sides without choosing one, even if our policies are socialist. Let's take shelter and hope this storm passes and doesn't rip the roof off of French democracy, leaving it open to the elements."
 FRA_Events.14.A: "Dammit! We're pinned between two sides!"

 FRA_Events.16.t: "Viénot Agreements"
 FRA_Events.16.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The political crisis that involved Syria in the last two years has recently dramatically grown to an unbearable level. Movements and protests which call for an immediate independence of the country have now started a sixty-day-strike, guided by their nationalist leaders, which is having devastating effects on the economy and on our national stability. in order to avoid further and worse consequences, an immediate encounter between our and their leaders has been made.\n\nThis morning, in Paris, our president and a Syrian delegation signed the Viénot Accords, where we both agreed for a gradual independence of Syria in exchange for some economic reliefs, French military presence in the country and aid in case of war.\n\nAcceding to their requests might not be positive for our image, but in these difficult times, we need to preserve our stability."
 FRA_Events.16.A: "Syria or something?"

 FRA_Events.17.t: "Dissolution of the North African Star"
 FRA_Events.17.d: "Reorganised in 1933, The Étoile Nord-Africaine independence movement still had ties to the PCF last decade, and although its current outfit is set on achieve Algeria's freedom through peaceful means, the risks of a revolution being sparked on our most valuable colonial holding, at the same time Europe experiences a volatile period, are too great to be ignored. We'll follow through with abolishing it legally, for the second time, and imprisoning their leaders for the time being. This should buy us enough time to deal with the situation on a more opportune date."
 FRA_Events.17.A: "Excellent!"

 FRA_Events.18.t: "Storm hits the Vendée Coast"
 FRA_Events.18.d: "An enormous storm has hit the Vendée Coast, causing enormous devastation. Many have been uprooted from their homes, the roads are wrecked, and the railway is destroyed. The damage on our infrastructure there cannot be repaired; we're going to have to salvage what's left. We should be able to recover from the storm quickly."
 FRA_Events.18.A: "Great. Another storm. Just what we needed."

 FRA_Events.19.t: "Inauguration of the Universal Exhibition of Paris"
 FRA_Events.19.d: "Today, we begin the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne. This great event brings together the greatest nations in the world, inviting them to showcase the best work of the artists they call their own. But, as all things these days, the exhibition was hijacked by competing nations. The Germans designed their pavilion to stand as a sort of bulwark against the Soviets, with the eagles and swastikas familiar to their regime and a large statue, depicting two naked men joining hands, staring defiantly at the Soviet pavilion across the pond. This one had atop its roof the famous statue, \"Worker and Kolkhoz Woman\" depicting a man and a woman carrying, respectively, a hammer and a sickle, thrusting forward. Italy, being Italian, attempted to bring forth the image of a benevolent dictatorship, with murals depicting Italian technology and the success of Corporatism. The British pavilion, by far, was the least impressive, being a simple white box, containing words that we French use that come from the English language. The event was a success, bringing thousands of spectators, but one wonders whether the competitiveness on display is a sign of times to come..."
 FRA_Events.19.A: "Who knows?"

 FRA_Events.21.t: "Nationalist riots in Tunisia"
 FRA_Events.21.d: "The violent grip of nationalism has once again taken hold of the Tunisian Protectorate.\n\nFor years, the Tunisians, led by the Destour Party, have been calling for independence. They demanded that we withdraw our forces from their soil, and that we simply abandon our business interests there. They lobbied for increased autonomy within the French Empire, and proclaimed that France should not dominate Tunisia's politics and society.\n\nHowever, losing Tunisia would have been a significant blow to our trade routes, causing irreparable damage to our economy and immense suffering to our people. As a result, the decision was made to reject these requests and maintain Tunisian State protection. This decision caused the party to become even more violent, and they have gained enormous support from the Tunisian people in recent weeks.\n\nAs a result, the decision was made to outlaw the Destour Party for the sake of regional stability and peace. The Tunisian Nationalist Movement was expected to disorganise and disintegrate as a result of the ban on their prominent nationalist party. However, the act had the exact opposite effect. Tunisian nationalists have united in their opposition to our occupation, resulting in violent riots in major Tunisian cities. There has even been talk of the party's radicals splitting off to form a separate, more nationalist party.\n\nTunisia's situation must be brought under control as soon as possible. Our country's well-being and prosperity are far more important than what some terrorists demand."
 FRA_Events.21.A: "We will not give in that easily!"

 FRA_Events.22.t: "Édouard Daladier President of the Council"
 FRA_Events.22.d: "It seems that the Popular Front government's attempts at keeping France together failed miserably, when today, following a series of events revolving the PCF, the Front's members and the recent developments at the Munich Conference, the PCF called for mass strikes, with the Popular Front's leadership denouncing them as \"Warmongers.\" Effectively, the government has collapsed and now all that remains is the Radical Party, led by Édouard Daladier. The new Liberal government has a legacy of failures to leave behind and great changes in Europe's horizon to endure. Now, in France, both the right and left strain even further from each other, and its wounds can be seen by all, friend or foe."
 FRA_Events.22.A: "Such a sudden change in course cannot be good for France."

 FRA_Events.24.t: "Peugeot 202"
 FRA_Events.24.d: "Following a incredible diner in the Bois de Boulogne district, the mobile manufacturer Peugeot has presented its latest model to its enthusiasts, the 202. Both tasteful, easy to mass-produce and accessible, this full-chassis instant-classic has come to be known for the quality of its improvements over previous models, including the whooping 100 km/h maximum velocity, and seem to be a new, constant, sight all across France."
 FRA_Events.24.A: "How do I get one?"

 FRA_Events.25.t: "150th Bastille Day"
 FRA_Events.25.d: "It's been 150 years since the Storming of the Bastille. Every single day since then, the French people have fought for democracy and rights, never losing hope, never tiring. Just as our ancestors raided that castle to show the King that they would not bow, so we must struggle against those who wish to usurp our democracy. This becomes more and more important in recent days, with the rise of extremist ideologies and threats to French sovereignty. The French Tricolore continues to wave in the roughest of weather. So we must uphold our ways. But this day is not one for worry. It is one for celebration of our past, the present, and whatever lies in the future. Fireworks will light the skies of Paris, and our children and their children will remember the sacrifices made for liberty."
 FRA_Events.25.A: "Vive La France!"

 FRA_Events.26.t: "Maurice Thorez Deserts to the USSR"
 FRA_Events.26.d: "With communism banned in France, and the PCF recognised as illegal, it seems that the party's Secretary General Maurice Thorez, rather than accepting the draft decided to flee into the Soviet Union. While this might be considered a hard blow against the far-left in France, partisanship is unlikely to wean, and even though many have considered armed resistance despite the outcome of the upcoming conflict, there are many that continue to claim that a a non-revolutionary power-struggle should remain the focus of the PCF remnants. Thorez himself claimed he'll continue to write for the the party's newspaper, the \"Humanité Clandestine,\" and his sway over the French left is likely to remain strong."
 FRA_Events.26.A: "We don't have time to worry about him now. Let him freeze in Siberia!"

 FRA_Events.28.t: "The Destour Question"
 FRA_Events.28.d: "If anything the recent protests against French rule over the protectorate of Tunisia has proven the need to swift action! The time has come to put an end to the Constitutional Liberal Party In Tunisia, once and for all. These rebellious acts against French authority are an obvious breach of the laws agreed by both sides by the civilian population, and shall not stand. The Destour shall be put down, either through peaceful dissolution or through force."
 FRA_Events.28.A: "Shut them Down!"

 FRA_Events.29.t: "Empire Colonial Français"
 FRA_Events.29.d: "French power stretches across the globe. We triumphed in the Race for Africa, and secure the colonies of the Germans after we defeated them in the Great War. We control Indochina, a rich source of tea, rice, coffee, pepper, coal, zinc and tin, and various islands that we can use to project naval power. However, our once glorious empire has fallen into disrepair. Our portion of Africa has no industrial base, guerrilla separatists harass our forces in Asia, and the dockyards in French Polynesia, among others, are small and useless. This must change. War is brewing in Europe, and we must have the ability to draw upon the power of our colonies should the French homeland ever fall into enemy hands. Soon, the French Colonial Empire will be a force to reckon with on its own."
 FRA_Events.29.A: "Let Us Begin"

 FRA_Events.30.t: "The Crackdown"
 FRA_Events.30.d: "Following an exacerbated address to the French media, Prime Minister Pierre-Étienne Flandin declared the mass strikes that have plagued France to be both illegal and dangerous for the nation's security, and promised to, with haste, put an end to it all. From there he and his councilors have retreated back to the Cabinet, and the press conference disbanded. Now, what actions will be carried out against the strikers is on the Prime Minister's hands, and the results of such actions are only his to bear. Union leaders, as well as the PCF leadership, have come together right after, expressing a desire to continue the resistance against the \"Republican Offensive\", one way or the other. The situation grows dire."
 FRA_Events.30.A: "Send in the Police!"
 FRA_Events.30.B: "Send in the Army!"

 FRA_Events.31.t: "Police Clashes With Unionists"
 FRA_Events.31.d: "News from Metropolitan France reached the rest of Europe today, when, after 12 hours of thorough negotiations between officers of the National Gendarmerie and the high echelon of Union leaders, an explosion was heard not too far from there. Someone had attempted to throw an explosive at the crowd, but missed by far. Soon enough, guards of the Municipal Police, alongside mounted Gendarmerie started to disperse the crowd by force, and the order was repeated throughout the country. In total, at least 13 wounded have been reported, but luckily no deaths occurred. The PCF, alongside most of the left have criticised the actions of Prime Minister Flandin, even going so far as to point out parallels to pre-republican France, but it seems the Strikes have died out, for now."
 FRA_Events.31.A: "I think this deserves a toast!"

 FRA_Events.32.t: "Five Dead In Police Action"
 FRA_Events.32.d: "Shootings across the streets of Paris today, when, as the army approached one of the last holdouts of the general strike, they were confronted by a crowd of workers, barricaded inside a car factory and refusing to come out. After heated discussions with the troops ordered there, a barrage of rocks and bottles from strikers resulted in a chaotic situation that ended with the whole building on fire. Five men perished in the flames. As the news reached the leaders of the CGT-SR and the PCF, both have agreed to, rather than calling off the strikes altogether, strengthen the resolve of the protests, and have urged all to return to the factories, and under no circumstances allow the general strikes to die down. Violence has erupted between the Police, Armed Forces and Strikers, PCF members and deserters all across Metropolitan France, and unconfirmed news about more deaths float around the press. Maurice Thorez, PCF's figurehead, has called upon several left-leaning politicians, French intelligentsia and union leaders to convene in an undisclosed location, and while the meaning of it is yet unknown, members of the police and Republican Coalition expect nothing good out of it."
 FRA_Events.32.A: "No! This cannot be happening"

 FRA_Events.33.t: "CGT-SR And PCF Ally Against Republican Aggression"
 FRA_Events.33.d: "Terrible news, as another morning rises, citizens of France, and all Europe, are shocked to know that, following a late-night meeting between leaders of the far-left and union leaders, the PCF and the CGT-SR have joined forces in what can only be called \"Revolutionary Action\", and with the help of disgruntled army deserters, have seized weapons and materials, following the example of the Spanish. Block by block, they advanced throughout the night, setting up barricades, local garrisons and overwatches, as well as engaging against police and army forces across the suburbs. At least 50 dead have been confirmed, as of yet, and, for the surprise of all, even prominent Generals seem to have joined the rebels. It seems that, once more, France is plunged into a revolution."

Local police, aided by the Gendarmerie, broke through lines of rushed assembled crowds around the PCF headquarters, as well as several known venues and the residences of specific individuals. It's yet unknown how this will affect the General Strike."

 FRA_Events.35.t: "The PCF Leadership Is Pardoned"
 FRA_Events.35.d: "In an interesting turn of events, Prime Minister Flandin has decided to allow the Parti Communiste Français' leadership to walk free from prison today, offering them a pardon in exchange for the ceasing of the general Strike and further cooperation with the Republican Coalition in the upcoming years. Interestingly enough, French newspapers discovered that, soon after they were freed, none else than Maurice Thorez himself asked for the other leaders from the now dissolved left-leaning leagues, as well as union leaders of the CGT, to convene into a yet unknown location."
 FRA_Events.35.A: "This might have been a mistake..."

 FRA_Events.36.t: "Maurice Thorez Declares The French Socialist Republic"
 FRA_Events.36.d: "A gunshot that might forever change France's destiny echoed across Paris today, when, after an incursion against a local garrison post in the outskirts of town, what could only be described as a human wave managed to take over and barricade the building. When the police was dispatched to the outpost, a single shot erupted into a bloody skirmish between PCF members, aided by partisans from the CGT and other minor far-left parties, and the municipal guard. Those who returned to town described none other than Maurice Thorez himself was leading the crowd, and without warning dozens of accounts started to come from across Metropolitan France, describing workers, many wielding weapons of foreign-design, taking over buildings, police stations and army outposts, setting fire to barracks and stealing provisions. Later, Maurice Thorez gathered an even bigger crowd, yet to be counted, and declared that \"the era of white terrorism must be brought down, with or without peace\" before declaring the French Socialist Republic. Europe watches in fear."

 FRA_Paul_Boncour_Government.1.d: "The bill pushed by Prime Minister Paul-Boncour to establish a more strict budgetary rigor to increase taxes and reduce public expenditure has proven to be immensely unpopular among French parliamentarians. As a result, the Chamber has withdrawn its confidence in the President of the Council. Naturally, this lack of support from the parliament caused the government to fall, ending the Paul-Boncour administration. The short-lived government only lasted one month before falling to the cruel game that is French politics."

However, the threat of a complete economic meltdown has shown us that we need to put aside our differences and reinforce our ties with the Socialists. Making new economic reforms that we can both agree on will make them easy to implement, and even create a long-lasting alliance between our parties."

 FRA_Servant_Budget.1.t: "Socialists do not vote to cut civil servants' budgets"
 FRA_Servant_Budget.1.d: "The Daladier administration has suffered a major setback. The Socialists in the Chamber have rejected the proposal of the President of the Council to cut the budget destined to the civil servants. The Chamber initially agreed with the plan presented by Minister of Budget Lucien Lamoureux, that consisted in a reducing the salaries of civil servants by five percent. However, attempts to push for further salary cuts have ended in a complete failure. With the lack of confidence of the Chamber, it is very likely that Daladier government will follow the same fate that the Paul-Boncour administration suffered months ago."

The plan presented by Minister of Budget Lucien Lamoureux of reduction of salaries by five percent was seen as a reasonable enough measure to get approved. The Radicals in the Chamber argued that pushing for further cuts would be a pointless and dangerous move, so they decided to accept the compromise. With this victory, the Daladier administration is one step closer to a balanced budget and will likely avoid the fate of its predecessor."

 FRA_National_Lottery.1.t: "The National Lottery is created"
 FRA_National_Lottery.1.d: "The recent finance law establishes a new French National Lottery to help war veterans and farmers affected by natural calamities. The decree also states the government will fix the conditions of organizations and modalities of the lottery within the next month. Originally, the concept of a National Lottery was introduced through the Royal Lottery of France by the old Bourbon monarchy. We can't deny the usefulness of some ideas of the Ancient Regime, even if our distaste for the monarchic form of government should be pretty obvious at this point. Charity raffles and other forms of clandestine lotteries are already pretty common, but hopefully this one will bring money to the state coffers."

 FRA_Agricultural_Law.1.t: "Agricultural law reorganizing the wheat market"
 FRA_Agricultural_Law.1.d: "Our attempts to regulate the wheat market are not enough. Since the surplus still influences the market, prices are continuing to decline, threatening to ruin many agricultural cooperatives. To help the farmers affected by the price declines, the government has issued a law fixing wheat prices. The decree establishes that wheat cannot be sold below the price of 115 francs per quintal, regardless if stocked under contract or not. This fixed price will increase every month by the Ministry of Agriculture to finance storage and handling costs. These measures however are temporary, and the market will return to normal once we solve this problem."
 FRA_Agricultural_Law.1.A: "This will help our farmers."

There was once a time when French ships ruled the waves, unopposed. Unfortunately, that time is long gone. But it does not need to be gone forever. we need to build up our fleet and modernise its doctrines so that the Marine Nationale will once again be feared. The French Tricolore will sail the seas, and every sailor will once more be proud to serve in the Marine Nationale. But before we can even dream of returning to such glory we have work to do. It's time to rearm the Navy."

 FRA_Tactiques_de_la_Legion_desc: "\"Divide and Conquer\" is more than a simple axiom taught to officers during their classes, its a rule of war. If one is outnumbered, but can identify a weaker concentration of enemies, isolated in a specific location, and manages to concentrate his firepower on it victory is assured. All and all, despite all the changes warfare has suffered, some things simply don't change."

 FRA_Colonial_Garrison: "Colonial Garrison"
 FRA_Colonial_Garrison_desc: "A worldwide empire like ours is not, by any means, easy to control. Manifestations, protests and insurrections could fire up in any moment and rapidly escalate to violent national revolts against our rule. In order to avoid this, some generals have proposed to provide our most precious colonies with new Garrison Regiments which will constantly maintain local stability. Also, having new troops dislocated around our empire could give us tactical advantages during wartime."

 FRA_Legion_Etrangere: "Légion Étrangère"
 FRA_Legion_Etrangere_desc: "The branch of our Army known as The \"Légion Étrangère\", is open to all foreigners willing to fight for our country. In its long and glorious history, it has accepted in its ranks men from all over the world and participated to various missions and wars. Unfortunately, since the end of The Great War, the numbers of volunteers in the Légion have dramatically decreased, leaving it almost useless for any task. By then publicising it and renewing by its old glory, we might be able to encourage foreigners to enlist in great numbers once again and serve loyally our great country, for every men is needed in these dark times."

 FRA_Speed_and_Tact_desc: "The days of grandeur, where pilots were seen as the modern knights, fighting with honour, and wielding only their skill and luck, to bring down their foes is now, thankfully, long gone. No more shall we allow brave young men to die in vain. The future of aerial warfare is one of speed and tactics, being able to adapt to ones need quickly enough and steadily enough as to not compromise either the operation or the command structure is a golden rule, and one that our staff is eager to follow."

 FRA_LIndochine: "L'Empire Colonial Français"
 FRA_LIndochine_desc: "French power stretches across the globe. We triumphed in the Race for Africa, and secured the colonies of the Germans after we defeated them in the Great War. We control Indochina, a rich source of tea, rice, coffee, pepper, coal, zinc and tin, and various islands that we can use to project naval power. However, our once glorious empire has fallen into disrepair. Our portion of Africa has no industrial base, guerrilla separatists harass our forces in Asia, and the dockyards in French Polynesia, among others, are small and useless. This must change. War is brewing in Europe, and we must have the ability to draw upon the power of our colonies should the French homeland ever fall into enemy hands. Soon, the French Colonial Empire will be a force to reckon with on its own."

 FRA_Blums_Labour_Reforms_desc: "The election of Blum’s government has brought a wave of strikes. Nearly 2 million workers have abandoned their posts, leaving our economy crippled. The strikes were unorganised and spontaneous, but many prominent members of the business community have met with Blum to help negotiate with the strikers. Blum has decided to institute a series of labor reforms, among which give workers the right to strike and created the 40-hour work week, then credit the labor unions for the new, so-called Matignon Accords. We have a majority in the Senate, so we should not wait to call a vote. Doubters of this new policy say that, however honourable its intentions, it may damage our economy even worse…"

 FRA_Price_Control_and_Public_Works_desc: "Our reforms have caused a huge increase in inflation. We are up 46%, and our opponents are using this as an excuse to attack our policies. We should institute large programs of price control to remedy this before our popular support evaporates. First off, we should create an Office du Blé to market agricultural products at fair prices for farmers, then we should shift the higher tax burden off the consumers and onto the producers. An unnecessary, but the popular program has been started: a massive public works project to improve the quality of life in our industrial centers and cities. This should ensure continuing support for our administration."

 FRA_Issue_Industrial_Grants: "Issue Industrial Grants"
 FRA_Issue_Industrial_Grants_desc: "Since the end of the war and the economic crash that followed it, France could, or rather needs, to reinvigorate its most basic industries. By reaching private investors and agreeing to subsidise large-scale development plans, we could, with some work, jumpstart some parts of the economy in no time. These factories could serve as the backbone of our civilian industry in the following years."

 FRA_Victory_of_the_Republican_Coalition: "Victoire de la Coalition Républicaine"
 FRA_Victory_of_the_Republican_Coalition_desc: "The ways of the past triumph again. The Republican Coalition, battered by internal power struggles between Louis Marin and Pierre-Étienne Flandin, managed to secure the popular vote, and with it, a continuation of their power. They also obtained a slight majority in the Senate, so the defeated leftists cannot enforce their will out of office. But Marin and Flandin cannot govern together, and nor will they accept compromises. Their long rivalry is coming to head. Marin, a democratic, but a liberal nonetheless, despises the radical rightist Flandin’s policies. Whichever one secures victory must lead us through dangerous times, and keep our country from falling back into the Absolutist ways of the past."

 FRA_Marins_Liberal_Conservative_Diet: "Marin's Liberal Conservative Diet"

 FRA_Tax_Breaks_for_Small_Businesses: "Tax Breaks For Small Businesses"
 FRA_Tax_Breaks_for_Small_Businesses_desc: "France has always been the ideal home for new opportunities, attracting those eager to build a new business and make their mark on the world. As our economy is faltering, many of these small enterprises are finding it difficult to stay afloat, while larger ones survive easily. In order to ease this burden, a simple solution has been approved; a blanket tax break on smaller businesses, reducing their debt to the government in these hard times. As they no longer will be burdened by excessive taxes, we will see growth, as income once taxed will flow into expansion. This should aid the economy somewhat, and provide more jobs."

 FRA_Austerity_Measures: "Austerity Measures"
 FRA_Austerity_Measures_desc: "The French people must give up the comforts of wealth in the name of the state. Our economy has taken many hits, and only true austerity can allow it time to recover. Additionally, we can redirect what is usually spent on frivolities to industrial expansion in Paris proper, giving new opportunities for the workers laid off as our economy struggled. We can also create a fund for research into modern industry technologies, aiding the disenfranchised and lowering the required skill for factory work."

 FRA_Flandins_Radical_Government: "Flandin's Radical Government"

If we are to have any chance on surviving on the years to come, these acts of treason against the Republic must, and shall, be treated as such."

We can no longer afford to allow far-left organizations to influence our citizens and stir them to rebellion against the government. Unfortunately, no other solution has presented itself but to ban these organizations completely. Although rooting out the members of the PCF, among others, may prove difficult and tax our resources somewhat, in the long run, our advisors say it will improve the overall stability of our proud nation."

 FRA_Country_Wide_Industrial_Development: "Country-Wide Industrial Development"
 FRA_Country_Wide_Industrial_Development_desc: "Our industry is lagging behind compared to that of our enemies, and, should war come to our lands, we will need to rely on a heavy industrial base to support us. We should use government funds and workers to construct industries in our largest cities, dealing them out to companies that we can trust. This development, although rushed and expensive, will help us in future projects."

 FRA_Corporative_Contracts: "Corporate Contracts"
 FRA_Corporative_Contracts_desc: "War is coming, and we're going to need a large, readily available industrial center to turn to the war effort. However, the government's resources are spent, and we simply cannot devote the funds needed into a large-scale construction project. Luckily, a few French corporations have proposed that we deal out the jobs to them, in return for assured government support. This should provide exactly what we need, while also freeing up funds that we can use elsewhere."

They must be ready to offer up their lives to the defense of our country, ready to abandon all to form a shield against France's enemies. Fearless men and women from across the country will fight those who threaten our sovereignty without longing for easier times. When they come, our foes will not find a nation of weak-willed, greedy individuals who care more about their possessions than the country's safety. We must rile up the people for war, and put bravery into the hearts of each one. War is coming. Our people must be ready."

 FRA_Girauds_Defensive_Approach: "Giraud's Defensive Approach"
 FRA_Girauds_Defensive_Approach_desc: "There is no need to risk the safety of the French nation pursuing wild dreams of new, offensive doctrines that will do little but get more Frenchmen killed. Henri Giraud, a Great War veteran who escaped from a German prison, advocated the strategy of building lines of fortification to stop the enemy in their tracks. Although this tactic may seem familiar to those who suffered in the trenches of the Great War, we have evolved and matured the doctrine in past years so that the enemy will not advance into France while our troops languish. But to defend properly, we must create additional fortifications along the Maginot Line and up to the coast. We may also need to consider the second line of fortifications along the Seine if the Maginot falls..."

 FRA_Indochine_Francaise: "Indochine Française"
 FRA_Indochine_Francaise_desc: "Ever since the 14th century, we have been involved in the Indochinese peninsula. French Indochina, the jewel of our Asian possessions, was formed in 1887. However, this proud testament to French military strength has fallen into disrepair. Frequent native revolts are barely suppressed, the ports of Vietnam are feeble, and it serves little use to our struggling economy. This cannot be allowed to reflect upon France. We need to allocate some of our resources to overhauling the current colonial structure and industrializing and modernizing the territories themselves. Hopefully, the territories may soon be consistent with our more developed colonies such as French Algeria."

 FRA_La_Defense_de_L_Indochine: "La Defense de L'Indochine"
 FRA_La_Defense_de_L_Indochine_desc: "Our possessions in Asia are threatened. The Japanese have gone to war against China, and they greedily eye French Indochina. Our foothold in the East must be protected. We might be able to begin a large fortification and defense project, importing workers and soldiers from France and some natives as well, to build fortifications on the coast and on the border with China, which may soon become a border with Japan. We can, alternatively, focus on taking the fight to whatever may threaten our colonies there, building bigger ports and air bases. But we face another threat; the Thai may be sympathetic to the Japanese idea of an East-Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere…"

 FRA_Trampoline_Into_the_Pacific_desc: "It is no secret our control over Indochina has been both recent and, already, wavering. Nevertheless, the worst has come to pass, and we still hold sway over southeast Asia; its fertile, resource-rich lands still coveted by the flourishing powers in the region. Rather than sit on our feet and wait for their attack, many have proposed using Indochina as our base of operations across all of the Pacific sea. Through land, sea, and air, we will show them, yet again, that France has yet to cower."

 FRA_Afrique_du_Nord_Francais_desc: "We possess a vast swath of land in North and Central Africa, ranging from Algiers in the north to Dakar in the west. However, this proud testament of French strength is unprotected, its citizens fighting against rightful French rule. To the East, the Italians see French Algeria as an essential piece to their false “Roman Empire,” and the Nationalist faction of the Spanish Civil War views Germany as an ally and is eager to take French Morocco. The people of Africa, especially the Berber tribes, must know that we are their protectors, willing to fight for them. But we only have so many resources. We will have to make a choice between Central Africa and North Africa."

 FRA_Franco_Tunisian_Markets: "Franco-Tunisian Markets"
 FRA_Franco_Tunisian_Markets_desc: "Time has come to approach the Tunisians more directly, if they were to expand our control over them to allow the free movement of goods, as well as tax-breaks for French investors, we could not only help them modernise but also have a greater deal of control over their civilian administration, which is sure to help should opposing forces east of them decide to move against us."

A plan to go through a complete restructuring of both administrations has been discussed for years, but seeing as these colonies, as well as France itself, might find themselves threatened either from within or without, it might be time to institute it."

 FRA_The_Grand_Council_of_French_West_Africa_desc: "Now that the war is won, and most importantly, France and its colonies find themselves back in a union, several high-level administrators in our African possessions have come to us with rumors of revolts being plotted all across the continent, and as our control over it weans, it might be a good idea to grant its governors a greater deal of autonomy, at least for the time being.

 FRA_Algerie_Francaise_desc: "Algeria is much more than a colony, and for all intents and purposes it's as part of Metropolitan France as the Centre, and despite the hardships that the interwar period has brought our Republic, we cannot allow for it to fall prey to a state of weakness wherein other states could have it seized from our hands, and as such, a through investment in its infrastructure must be put forth."

 FRA_Dissolve_the_Etoile_Nord_Africaine_desc: "The North-African Star, a group led of anti-colonial, independence-seeking Algerians natives that, albeit vocally peaceful, have been discovered to have ties with the PCF back in France proper, have been a torn in our administration's foot for quite a long time now. To secure our position of France as Algeria's sovereign, we might with to use this revelation to accuse the North-African Star's leadership of conspiracy and have it dissolved."

 FRA_Ban_Arabic: "Ban Arabic"
 FRA_Ban_Arabic_desc: "The linguistic debacle in Algeria is creating more and more problems. In an effort to civilise these people, we introduced French into their schools to replace the native Berber tongue and Arabic. However, this has only worsened the situation, as these three languages and their supporters vie for the control of the education system. Obviously, it would be advantageous to our colonial rule if French was the lingua franca, so to speak, as assimilating the Algerian people decreases chances of revolt and allows them to identify more with the Pied-Noirs, our settlers. Thus, it is necessary that we outlaw Arabic, that backward language, to more fully introduce the Algerians to European and Christian culture. Of course, this may destabilise the people and the region; every restriction we add anger them more."

 FRA_Expand_the_Maginot_desc: "The Maginot line is supposed to defend France from any threat coming east, and despite its obvious potential to keeping the Republic safe, voices from within both the cabinet and our staff are voicing doubts about its effectiveness. They have pointed out that any invasion force on our Eastern border might resort to the same tactic employed by Germany during the Great War, bypassing our fortifications completely and instead coming through the Ardennes to strike at us. This, coupled with the degree at which warfare's speed increases, presents an obvious threat could seriously endanger France's freedom, to say nothing of our pride. We should fund an expansion of the Maginot line alongside our border with Belgium and Luxembourg, if we are to ensure its effectiveness."

 FRA_Social_Reforms: "Social Reforms"
 FRA_Social_Reforms_desc: "France, despite her legacy, has yet to abide to the ethos of \"Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity\" itself coined in the last century. Indeed, the French nation is under constant siege, an attack perpetrated by its own citizens, by entrenched democratic reactionaries, by rich businessmen, by a brainwashed group of extremists, and lastly, it's own society. Our workers have been denied their fair, due share for far too long. By employing safety-nets, granting tax-breaks for union-members, demanding more safety regulations and a more, we can unite France once more."

Our workers die in our factories, children starve in the streets, and our society is divided to its very core. There is little outside of France that is worth a drop of blood from a single of its workers. Until their worries are gone and their needs are quenched, we will not threaten the fabric of our own society, nor the safety of our people in the name of the elite's blood-lust."

Ever since Charles X, king of France, invaded the Ottoman protectorate in 1830, Algeria has been part of our nation, our first colony and the pride of our nation. Now, after we have brought the Algerian people into the modern world, France needs their help. Many French abstain from military service, reminiscent of the horrors of the Great War. But the North Africans have not yet been called to serve in the Armée de Terre, and, as we find ourselves short of the men required to maintain peace in Europe, these men, although black, seem a very attractive replacement. We will have to make vague promises of independence to convince these men to heed our call, but, at the end of their service, they might be angry if we renege on our promise. Although they will never replace true Frenchmen, they should be conscripted as soon as possible through a large-scale recruitment drive."

Sadly, much like the rest of Algeria, the years after the Great War could not have been any less kind to it, and it may have been left behind from Algiers. Still, such a important province must not be susceptible to any invasion force, as such could represent a risk for France itself."

Although this will mean using our capital, Paris, as a defensible position, doubtlessly costing thousands of civilian lives, it will ensure a stable, easily defensible holding point to weaken the enemy as they throw themselves against it, opening them up for a counterattack to drive them from our home. Our engineers and strategists assure us it will be a suitable, worthy investment in the name of defense."

 FRA_French_Economic_Reform_1: "French Economic Reform"
 FRA_French_Economic_Reform_1_desc: "Even a proud nation like France is dependent on the avatars of the international market. Like other countries around the globe, France has been deeply affected by the crash of the stock market in 1929. Even if we managed to avoid the worst of the depression, the effects of the crisis still prove to be catastrophic for the economy. Millions of workers in endless rows looking for employment after countless factories and businesses closed their doors, affecting our production capabilities considerably. Our debt increases more and more, threatening to collapse the financial system.\nIn a time where the populace is starting to shift to the far-left and far-right parties, the French political establishment has decided that deep economic reform is the best course of action. The government will intervene in the crucial sectors of the industry and agriculture to safeguard the interests of workers and investors and create new institutions to regulate the market and collect money to protect the poorest levels of society. But the biggest challenge will be implementing budget cuts not only in unproductive areas of the state but also cutting the huge salaries of bureaucrats and politicians. France is at the brink of ruin, and only a swift decisive action will save it from the jaws of fascism."
 
 FRA_Deep_Economic_Crisis: "Profonde Crise Économique\nDeep Economic Crisis"
 FRA_Deep_Economic_Crisis_desc: "Like other countries around the world, France has been deeply affected by the Stock market crash in 1929 and the following depression. While France has so far not been as severely affected by the depression as other countries, the effects are still proving to be a great burden on our economy. Millions of young men have become unemployed, while businesses and factories are closing down, left and right, decreasing our production capabilities. Furthermore, our national debt has begun increasing steadily and will reach a critical mass unless the situation improves in due time. \nThe government so far tried to reduce the effects of the crisis by following a strict restrictive and austerity focused policy, which greatly angered the populace who is now steadily beginning to flock towards communist and fascist political parties, in the hopes of overturning the status quo. While the situation so far is still under control, the leaders of France still have a lot of work to do in order to save the economy and by extension the republic."

 FRA_Politicized_Staff: "État-Major Politisée"
 FRA_Politicized_Staff_desc: "France has always been a polarised country in terms of politics ever since the revolution, the moderates, and the Jacobins, the Bonapartists and the republicans, the radicals and the conservatives, it's all part and parcel of the great system of democracy. But just as any state, democratic or not, the nation is driven by the institutions and apparatuses that it is comprised of but while in other countries these institutions tend to be dominated by a constricted social class we in France pride ourselves in being able to say that every institution has representation for all facets of society.\n\nHowever this, while sounding quite good the daily newspaper it is not so healthy for the administration of the state and especially the defense. Our officer corps and general staff are just as fragmented and polarised as the rest of our citizens, bickering over not only military doctrines and divisional organization but also over ministers and political philosophy. With the Dreyfus Affair still fresh in the mind of many, it seems that unless a serious crackdown on such political activism within the corps is enacted the infighting will continue to undermine the security of our very state."

## Return of Hatay
##########################################
 FRA_Hatay_Issue.1.t: "The Hatay Issue"
 FRA_Hatay_Issue.1.d: "For some time now, Turkey has been attempting to gain control over the province of Hatay, which has been owned by our mandate in Syria, and have also been lobbying the League of Nations. While there has been much discussion and deliberation with Turkish officials about what to do with the region, we have finally come to an agreement over what to do with the province.\n\nThe province of Hatay will be officially attached to Turkey through an agreement entitled “The Arrangement for the Final Settlement of Territorial Questions between Turkey and Syria”, with many calling it by its shorter name, the “Franco-Turkish Agreement”. This will benefit both us and the Turkish; they will be content with the fact that Hatay has returned to their control, while we will hopefully be able to guarantee their neutrality and keep them from entering the German sphere. We will also be entering into a non-aggression pact with the Turkish as well, which can only yield positive results for both nations."

 FRA_Le_Front_Populaire_category_desc: "\n\n\n£decision_header_FRA_Front_Populaire£\n\n\n\nThe Popular Front, no doubt, is composed of a wide variety of political views and opinions. From communists to liberals, we all came together to fight for a better France. However, we're becoming increasingly unstable, and the continued rise of unemployment isn't helping. It could all lead to a possible collapse of the front. To prevent such a political disaster, we need to secure support in the party and stop outside influences from fascists and the right who want us to crumble. The longer we preserve the front, the more we can make a difference in people's lives."

With Hitler’s rise to power in Germany, and new threats appearing every day, we need to build a new pact in Eastern Europe dedicated to preventing another world war. However, we need to deal with our borders with Germany first, which have been in debate since the war ended. Then, we can start building an alliance that will end the possibility of another conflict instead of beginning another one."
