### Wehrmacht Putsch
 GER_Establish_Provisional_Government: "Establish Provisional Government"
 GER_Establish_Provisional_Government_desc: "With the coup d'état a success and the fall of the traitorous Nazi regime, our nation currently has no government, with the military acting as only a resemblance of it, fighting of loyalists to the corrupt, incompetent, and evil regime that came before it, but without any administrative or bureaucratic powers whatsoever. As such, we shall create a provisional government, one that will ensure legitimacy to the new rulers of Germany, while keeping the status-quo as it is, a Wehrmacht ruled government. While Democracy is a popular system our countrymen wants, given the current situation, we can’t afford such luxury of free elections."
 GER_Denazification: "Denazification"
 GER_Denazification_desc: "The Nazi regime, while gone and the time they ruled was limited, they nevertheless reshaped German society, with propaganda still fresh in the minds of our citizens and are still committed to the corrupt and dehumanizing ways of Hitler. As such, we’re obligated as protectors of the people to remove such propaganda from the minds of the citizens and cleanse it from the society, ensuring that no such person like Hitler would ever gain prominence in our country ever again. Not only that, but we will conduct a series of “show trials” on prominent Nazi officials, making a clear example out of them and for the rest of Germany."
 GER_Reeducation_Program: "Reeducation Program"
 GER_Reeducation_Program_desc: "While our program of Denazification is still ongoing, many of the soldiers and officers within our Wehrmacht, while they sided with us, still have sympathies to the corrupt Nazi regime. These officers, mostly young, are confused about morality, what is right and what is wrong. They have been unfortunately manipulated by the propagandists of Hitler who were able to make these young soldiers into loyal Nazis. As such, we shall undertake efforts into reforming and purging the minds of our young soldiers their propaganda of Nazism, and educate them to the ways that are compatible with our ideology instead."
 GER_Purge_the_Army: "Purge the Army"
 GER_Purge_the_Army_desc: "While the Wehrmacht has proven itself as an invaluable ally in our struggle against the Nazi regime, the people within aren’t. These soldiers, while they sided with us in our struggle to defeat the Nazis, they are still sympathetic to them, the traitors who have perverted Germany and imposed their messed up image of it throughout the Fatherland. While some members of our leadership suggest that we simply educate them, this is simply unfeasible, as they are traitors, and they must be treated as such. We shall purge the Wehrmacht of anyone who holds sympathies to the Nazi regime, regardless of rank. They must be taught a lesson for adopting the teachings of an evil, monstrous regime."
 GER_Lift_Martial_Law: "Lift Martial Law"
 GER_Lift_Martial_Law_desc: "To ensure total military control over the nation, we have declared martial law ever since the foundations of our current regime were placed. Since then, an era of stability and freedom from the Nazi terrorists was created, with the military ensuring that the Nazi menace wouldn’t resurface in our lands once more. However, the declaration of Martial Law has started to take its toll on our rule, for violence and opposition to our current regime is not due to Nazis, but to the regular German populace, who want the military out of politics as soon as possible. With limited options, we shall lift Martial Law and initiate the transition period to a new Germany, one that will decide Germany’s future and potentially the world."
 GER_Consolidate_the_Junta: "Consolidate the Junta"
 GER_Consolidate_the_Junta_desc: "While the people may clamor for “Democracy” and “Freedom”, they should know better than these fragile concepts are the very reason why the Nazi menace was elected into office. Not to mention that our rule has merely just begun, parties of all ideologies in the political spectrum have started mobilizing their efforts into influencing public policy, both through peaceful and violent means. As such, it is the obligation of the Wehrmacht to ensure Germany is ruled through an iron fist, as it is the sole protectors of the German people. Democracy may come, but for now, the military shall stay."
 GER_Restore_the_Kaiserreich: "Restore the Kaiserreich"
 GER_Restore_the_Kaiserreich_desc: "For decades, Germany had a golden age, if you may say. Rapid industrialization, the world’s most powerful military, and the 2nd largest economy in the world, those dreams were realized when the Kaiserreich was ruling our glorious Germany. However, due to the mishaps from the Weltkrieg, we have been stripped of the power and destiny we were meant to have. As a result, we had a fragile democracy, coupled with the Nazi menace. To ensure Germany’s survival, we should restore the Kaiserreich, for they are the true saviors of Germany, always was and always will be."

 GER_Encourage_Christian_Trade_Unions: "Encourage Christian Trade Unions"
 GER_Encourage_Christian_Trade_Unions_desc: "While Trade Unionism has been a blight on our country for many decades and constant threats to disrupt our economic efforts by calling for a General Strike, it is simply not possible to disband all Trade Unions without greatly disrupting the general stability of Germany. However, there is the possibility of supporting the variety of Trade Unions, whose aims and political attitude somewhat align with ours.\n\nBy supporting these Trade Unions we will essentially bring them under our control, which will allow us to influence actions and prevent any harmful, communist agitation. Furthermore, our support will allow these Unions to attract more work, which will hopefully restrict the power of communist or socialist unions."

 GER_The_Second_Ludendorff: "A Second Ludendorff?"
 GER_The_Second_Ludendorff_desc: "As the Weltkrieg wore on, Wilhelm II delegated much of the decision-making process to General Erich Ludendorff and other army generals, retaining only ceremonial and honorific duties, allowing the German General Staff to run the country, and effectively turning the empire into a military dictatorship.\n\nNow that they have brought Wilhelm II back from his exile as the legitimate ruler of Germany, the General Staff has an opportunity to do the exact same thing once again. They intend to limit the Kaiser to nothing but a figurehead role and keep the power between themselves. This time though, they hope to provide strong enough leadership that will win Germany the inevitable war with the Western democracies."

 GER_Prussian_Constitutionalism_desc: "The House of Hohenzollern ran the German Empire ever since its formation by using a unique and aptly named political system called Prussian Constitutionalism. This form of governance included a constitution and a guided democratic system, leaving the rest of the executive powers in the hands of the Kaiser. Unfortunately, this all came to an end after the Weltkrieg and the creation of the Weimar Republic.\n\nAfter the coup by the army on the Nazi regime run by Adolf Hitler, which succeeded the federal government, Kaiser Wilhelm II returned to the throne. Since his return, the Kaiser has repaired the damage done by the previous administrations and reformed the ineffective parts of the government. These repairs and reforms have ushered in the return of Prussian Constitutionalism to Germany, and a new era of prosperity for the country will soon follow."

 GER_Empower_the_Junkers: "Empower the Junkers"
 GER_Empower_the_Junkers_desc: "In the years before the Weltkrieg, the Junkers, a noble class of militaristic, reactionary aristocrats, controlled most of the German countryside and military. Fiercely loyal to Kaiser and country, a Junker could always be trusted to lead a regiment or offer wise counsel in times of crisis- qualities the Kaiser has found lacking since his return.\n\nFor the Kaiser's Reich to survive, he will need officers and administrators that he can trust, and who is more suited for the task than those who performed it admirably for centuries? The ineffectual Weimar Republic stripped away the lands and titles of the nobility, but the Kaiser now has the opportunity to right this injustice. Should their estates and titles be restored, the Junkers would surely return to their rightful place at the right hand of the Kaiser."

 GER_Halt_Agrarian_Reform: "Halt Agrarian Reform"
 GER_Halt_Agrarian_Reform_desc: "While our restoration of the Pre-Weimar conditions is constantly progressing, there were many people and families besides the Kaiser and the Hohenzollerns that were wronged when the Kaiserreich fell apart and the November-traitors declared their republic, with hundreds of noble families losing both their titles and estates.\n\nTo restore their god-given rights and gain new allies, we will officially restore every noble title, as well as granting a few new ones to a select group of people that showed their worth in the last months. This will bring us one step closer to the Glory Days of the Kaiserreich, while also ensuring the goodwill of the new German aristocracy."

 GER_Aristocratic_Land_Base: "Aristocratic Land Base"
 GER_Aristocratic_Land_Base_desc: "The restoration of the Empire requires that the nobility returns to their legitimate place within the German state and the best way to achieve that is to return them the control over the land. To consolidate the power of the monarchy, the Kaiser has decided to distribute a considerable amount of land among the German aristocracy. \n\nThis will also allow us to hold more political power without relying on the peasants' organizations, facilitating future agricultural projects. The nobility is here to stay!"

 GER_Restart_the_Steel_Cartels: "Restart the Steel Cartels"
 GER_Restart_the_Steel_Cartels_desc: "Germany is abundant in both Iron and Coal, which means that steel production is obviously meant to flourish. Recently, there have been more and more independent factories producing steel, which keeps the competition between the different producers high. Some larger companies have decided to band together to eliminate the competition, which is technically illegal, however, as the German army and state grow, so does the consumption and therefore need for steel. We shall allow these so-called “Steel Cartels” or monopolies in the steel industry, as long as they keep the prices acceptable and production high."

 GER_Privatize_Industrial_Sectors: "Privatize Remaining State Industries"
 GER_Privatize_Industrial_Sectors_desc: "Our Kaiser was chosen by the grace of God to lead Germany and her people, not to become bogged down in petty commerce, industrial production, and labor disputes. \n\nUpon the Kaiser's return, his government found itself in possession of several key industries, including steel mills, mines, railways, shipyards, and public utilities, all of which are below the dignity of our government. By privatizing these firms- turning them over to private individuals or selling them to the highest bidder, we can make the German economy more competitive, both domestically and internationally. Mass privatization of state industry would also make us some powerful friends in the business community, whose support we will need moving into the future.\n\nLet the government govern, and the businessmen do business."

With our economy still short of its full potential, it would seem prudent to break open the books and call in the experts.\n\nSeveral current economists willing to work with us are Hjalmar Schacht, a former board member of Dresdner Bank, Mayor of Leipzig Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, and banker Walther Funk. Any of these men would surely have useful input on the running of our economy into the future."

 GER_A_State_within_a_State: "A State within a State"
 GER_A_State_within_a_State_desc: "The Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH) has recently been slowly vying for more autonomy of the army, and therefore less civilian oversight. Many see this as an obvious attempt of the Army to gain more power, letting them do almost anything outside of Germany’s borders and perhaps do some unwarranted acts inside the German nation. The Civilian Government has noticed this “power grab”, and have instead vied for the expansion of civilian oversight over the army so that the Army would have “better morals” and would not threaten the civilian populations of Germany and foreign nations. The tensions have come to a breaking point, and something needs to be done."

 GER_Imperial_Bureaucracy: "Imperial Bureaucracy"
 GER_Imperial_Bureaucracy_desc: "The Imperial Bureaucracy suffered in the years of the former Empire. The decentralized model they followed destroyed the efficiency of their government, as the nation was not united in political actions. Prussia was centralized, and their efficiency allowed them to eventually evolve into a strong German Empire. However, during the rebellions of 1848, the German Empire began to become decentralized. Some political figures have been pushing a decentralized agenda, but we must remind them that decentralization was the political destruction of the second German Empire. \n\nNow that the German Empire has been reestablished, we must get with the times, and ensure increased political power at the cost of power to the federal states. We must push a new German Empire, united under a central, authoritative government that carries out the will of the Emperor and his people. We must fix the Imperial Bureaucracy to launch Germany into political perfection."

 GER_Restore_the_Integrity_of_the_Reichstag: "Restore the Integrity of the Reichstag"
 GER_Restore_the_Integrity_of_the_Reichstag_desc: "The Reichstag is one of the legislative bodies of Germany and has been around since the unification of the country, surviving the chaotic Weimar Republic, established after that our defeat in the Weltkrieg. Then, Adolf Hitler and the NSDAP came along and hamstrung the Reichstag and its administrative capabilities, rendering it effectively useless, as the Nazis could then pass whatever law they wanted. \n\nBut now, as Kaiser Wilhelm II has returned to the throne of Germany, he has called for the restoration of the Reichstag’s power and the election of new members to repair the integrity of the institution and restore the German people’s faith in it."

 GER_Enforce_Decentralization: "Enforce_Decentralization"
 GER_Enforce_Decentralization_desc: "The officials that have taken the power of Germany after the fall of the Empire pushed Centralization reforms, and many local and state political entities lost their power. Since the Empire has been reborn we must go about pushing new reforms to reverse this process. By giving power back into the hands of the federal states, we can go about making a more efficient bureaucratic process. \n\nEfficiency is key in the German state, and we must not lose it by keeping the reforms of the Weimar Republic and German Reich. For the German Empire to be strong, the federal states have to be strong. In order to make the federal states strong, we must enforce Decentralization and give power to the states."

 GER_Curtail_the_Wehrmacht: "Curtail the Wehrmacht"
 GER_Curtail_the_Wehrmacht_desc: "The Army overstretched its boundaries in the Weltkrieg, seizing control of Germany from under the Monarchy's nose and making the honorable Kaiser a powerless figurehead. Their boneheaded decision-making was one of the factors that led to our nation being subverted and destroyed from within by red front and democratic elements, and they must not be able to run amok again. Thus, we shall limit their power in influencing civilian government and take measures to prevent them from seizing control. Never another 1918, Long Live The Kaiser!"

 GER_A_Guided_Puppet: "A Guided Puppet"
 GER_A_Guided_Puppet_desc: "The Army proved capable of ruling the country in the Weltkrieg, and once again serves as a superb advisory body to the Kaiser. As their power has grown in Germany, so has their influence over civilian offices and the political proceedings of the nation - so much so do they influence the Kaiser and the bodies of governance under him, that they have become what amounts to puppetmasters. \n\nOf course, the Army only has the nation's interests at heart, and the Kaiser knows this! So long as he listens to them, Germany shall not falter - it shall remain strong and attain its rightful place in the sun! The Kaiser and the Army together shall forge a Reich that shall last a thousand years!"

 GER_Bring_Back_the_Old_Guard: "Bring Back the Old Guard"
 GER_Bring_Back_the_Old_Guard_desc: "In order to make ourselves more popular in the eyes of the German people, we should bring back some familiar faces to serve in a figurehead capacity. The mere appearance of these people in our administration should be able to calm whatever nerves the German people have and allow them to put their trust in us. This will make it easier for us to implement our plans for the country. The perfect example of the type of man we are looking for would be the old Weltkrieg General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, also known as the Lion of Africa."

 GER_Keep_High_Military_Spending: "Keep High Military Spending"
 GER_Keep_High_Military_Spending_desc: "The German Army has always been the backbone of the German state. To reduce its funding would be as though to stop watering a plant - it would be counterproductive and prevent Germany from flourishing. Surrounded by enemies, we must stay strong - survival of the fittest, fight or die. This is the state of the world, and to not recognize it would be silly.\n\nThe military shall keep its massive funding. Germany's army shall outshine all other nations now into the future, as it has done in the past. Every man shall be armed with a gun that any British Noble would foam at the mouth for! Our Artillery will block out the sun and our tanks shall churn up the ground into ash! Vorwärts, Deutsche Truppen!"

 GER_German_Discipline: "German Discipline"
 GER_German_Discipline_desc: "The German people, apart from a small group, possess an innate ability to be self-disciplined and understand the importance of hard work and what role it plays in their potential future successes. Our people’s ability to remain disciplined in even the harshest conditions is extremely helpful for the army, as the standard soldier will almost always end up having the advantage over his enemy. The army training programs can afford to be shortened as well, as the discipline possessed by almost every recruit allows them to learn the basic techniques much faster than our current and future adversaries."

 GER_Autonomy_of_the_OKH: "Autonomy of the OKH"
 GER_Autonomy_of_the_OKH_desc: "As we continue to expand the Oberkommando des Heeres, there are reports from officers operating in the headquarters that the Kaiser, in his grand authority, is interfering in military matters. Whilst his input his valued, many believe he is overstepping his bounds, as he is not a soldier but a monarch, and should leave the battle-plans to the officers. Others say that it is the emperor's right to intervene, and his decisions should be upheld as executive orders. It is true that the Kaiser is our leader, but the soldiering should be relegated to the generals, and as such a degree of autonomy should be given to the OKH, to ensure stability in the high command and to guarantee loyalty throughout the officer core."

 GER_Army_with_a_State: "Army with a State"
 GER_Army_with_a_State_desc: "There are only two things that are constant in the Kaiserreich - The Kaiser and His Army. Even before the days of the Empire, the military has always played a vital role in determining our future. They decide what wars we wage, they decide what threats are in the Reich, and most importantly, they decide whether to allow the common man his right to choose the nation's future.\n\nAs we have seen throughout human history, the military is a capable and effective institution for both national security and governance. They are the guardians of the state and, consequentially, are the state itself. Given their efficiency and competence, why would we relinquish their power? When the enemy is at the gates, we don't just throw our swords to the furnace, we stab our enemies with it.\n\nAs such, this so-called notion of “Exercising Civilian Authority” is ludicrous at best and dangerous at worst. If the Kaiserreich is to claim its hegemony, it must have the guidance of its guardians. The State shall be the Army, the Army shall be the State."

 GER_A_Militant_Monarchy: "A Militant Monarchy"
 GER_A_Militant_Monarchy_desc: "The German Empire, under the leadership of the great Kaiser Wilhelm III and his loyal government, is stable and finally ready to take on the challenges that the country will most certainly face when we attempt to take our rightful place in the Sun and inflict revenge upon the Western democracies. This effort will be aided by the fact that the German military has received so much attention under the Kaiser’s administration, due to the extreme militarist fervour that he has induced among the German people, who now see the military not as a threat to the system, as the Weimar fools wanted them to believe, but as the protector of the fatherland and their very way of life!"

 GER_Invest_in_Military_Industries: "Invest in Military Industries"
 GER_Invest_in_Military_Industries_desc: "Now, as tension is rising around the world and we look to finally have our place in the sun, it would be prudent for us to build up and substantially invest into our military industries so that we can produce large amounts of small-arms, armoured vehicles, artillery and other pieces of useful equipment to continue expanding our army, keep it well equipped and have a substantial stockpile in reserve so that it can perform at the highest possible level on multiple fronts in a long, drawn-out conflict."

 GER_Pan_German_Aspirations: "Pan-German Aspirations"
 GER_Pan_German_Aspirations_desc: "Hitler and his Nazi brownshirts were always doomed to fail, as the very ideas his movement was built upon were deeply flawed and misguided on so many levels. But they were right about one thing, that we should make it our duty to unite all ethnic Germans and German-speaking peoples under one great nation. This objective will require us to assert our claims over this land on the countries that currently possess it. They won’t like it, but they’ll just have to accept that nothing is going to get in the way of us uniting our people."

 GER_Restore_Prussian_Militarism: "Restore Prussian Militarism"
 GER_Restore_Prussian_Militarism_desc: "The Kingdom of Prussia had a strong sense of militarism, and under the rule of the House of Hohenzollern, made Germany into a great empire, instilling that sense of militarism among all the German people. But, after our draining defeat in the Weltkrieg and the signing of the Versailles Treaty, many of our people lost their militaristic attitude, including the Prussians.\n\nBut now, after the fall of the weak Weimar Republic, the end of the Nazi experiment, and the return of a Kaiser to the throne, we now have a chance at rectifying this problem. To do so, we will need to make the Prussian people confront their undeniable military heritage, which dates back all the way to the Teutonic Order. This process should go much smoother, now that the House of Hohenzollern is back. The return of Prussian militarism will then play a role in reinvigorating public support all over Germany for the military and its various branches, which will aid recruitment and give us the manpower needed to inflict revenge on our enemies."

 GER_A_Nationalist_Monarchy: "A Nationalist Monarchy"
 GER_A_Nationalist_Monarchy_desc: "When the Weltkrieg started, nationalist fervor carried our Kaiser through until the end. Wilhelm II’s will and patriotic stance were just what the country needed to go on until the end. However, our victory, stolen from us so viciously and brutally by the traitors in the government, when they exiled our glorious monarch from the country. Now the House of Hohenzollern reigns once more, and with it comes the Prussian attitude. \n\nYou are not just a German, you are a patriot, a brave person willing to give it all for the Kaiser. This must return to Prussia, after years of the democratic process which has allowed our beautiful nation and its people to become disinterested and disconnected to others. \n\nNo more. We shall fight for the Kaiser, and for Deutschland no matter what. Nationalism has prevailed before, it can prevail again, and so we must pick up the torch from where it was dropped two decades prior, and relight the banner of the Kaiser. Deutschland Über Alles!"

 GER_Investment_in_Rural_Areas: "Investment in Rural Areas"
 GER_Investment_in_Rural_Areas_desc: "Though, of course, there was no fighting on German soil, the Weltkrieg left its mark on the German countryside. Chemicals previously used for fertilizer spat shells across no man's land, and one-time farmhands wielded rifles at Verdun and the Somme. \n\nWhen peasant farmers returned home after the Armistice, they found their fields barren, their herds depleted, and their homes and barns in disrepair. The weak Weimar government tried and failed to restore German agriculture to its prewar state; nearly 20 years after the war, German agriculture is still a pale shadow of its former self.\n\nThe task now falls to us to restore the bedrock of German society, and ensure the specter of another “Turnip Winter” never haunts the Kaiser's loyal subjects ever again."

 GER_Stand_Against_France: "Stand Against France"
 GER_Stand_Against_France_desc: "In 1919, a treaty was signed by the Entente Powers designed to humiliate and destroy Germany in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles Palace. This treaty stripped us of our rightful land, forced upon us war reparations, and limited the strength that we could have grown to. This was all done at the incessant and violent urging of France, who gained the provinces of Elsass and Lothringen, core provinces of our nation. In the 1920s, they marched into the Ruhr and brutally beat down our citizens and stole our industry. France has always been Germany's mortal enemy, and as such we must work to rectify the dominance of France. \n\nAs such we shall be declaring Elsass-Lothringen part of our territory, and do thus announce our claim to those lands. We shall take back what is rightfully ours, and we shall stand tall, on the rotten and bloated corpse of France."

Almost two decades after his forced abdication, Kaiser Wilhelm III, 'The Young Wilhelm' has returned to claim his rightful place at the head of the German state.\n\nKaiser Wilhelm III is quite a different man from his father. While Wilhelm II had the reputation of being quite a hot-headed fellow, making brash decisions that led not only Germany but Europe itself down a dark path, Wilhelm III is known to be a coolheaded, calculating fellow. A factor he shares with his father is his interest in militarism - and by Gott, does he surpass him there. The Young Wilhelm's expansionist rhetoric and condemnation of Versailles is second to none, even among the ideologues inside the Reichstag. \n\nThe Young Wilhelm also has links to many key conservative parties and figures, most notably the DNVP and it's leader, Alfred Hugenberg - along with a variety of the old guard generals and high-up civil servants. Needless to say, Wilhelm has long been preparing for this day."

The populist stance and nationalistic ideals are just what the nation needs after overthrowing the idiotic despot and his cronies. The fascists who held government were not patriots, but mere hyenas, who would strengthen themselves and their allies, and not what really matters, like the actual people of Germany. However, Wilhelm III, and the monarchy in general, are accomplishing what really needs to be done. People who would normally not give politics the time of day have taken notice of our new Kaiser. His charismatic approach to the nation, combined with his oratory skills and nationalist agenda has propelled the Royal Family and the DNVP to new heights.

His leadership, charisma, and competence match that of the Iron Chancellor, and his political instincts make him a killer behind the scenes.

War heroes like August von Mackensen and Ludendorff served the nation with valor during the Weltkrieg, and their services are needed now more than ever. A rapidly expanding army needs a rapidly expanding officer corps, and who to lead it better than the men with more experience than anyone else in the country?\n\nThus, as is the Kaiser's command, so it shall be - these old generals shall be called to lend a helping hand to Germany once more, and ensure it's placed in the sun before the Earth takes them whence they came."

 GER_Retire_the_Old_Guard_desc: "These days, a loyal and committed army is incredibly important, and if our new Kaiser is to lead Germany and its people into a great and prosperous future, the army must have any dissenting influences removed from it at any cost. It doesn’t matter how talented they are on the battlefield if they are not completely committed to the monarchy and if there is even a slight chance that they turn troops against the country, they must be removed, but quietly, so instead of firing them, or forcing them into resignation, we should persuade them to “retire”. The first victims of our persuasive efforts will be the generals loyal to Adolf Hitler. This will ensure that their dangerous ideas and influence is removed from our army. "

With the rise of the Deutschnationale Volkspartei and its monarchist, aristocratic policies, many thought that the ordinary people would find themselves forgotten once more by the old order, back again.\n\nIt would serve us well to incorporate some populist rhetoric and policies into our platform, which would help bolster our base of supporters as well as draw the people away from the communists and other opposition groups."

 GER_Sideline_Democratic_Process_desc: "While the new Kaiserreich is a parliamentary democracy on paper, the years of the Weimar Republic and the anarchy that threatened to consume Germany due to the failures of the democratic system have all but confirmed the Kaiser's observation that senseless mob rule will lead to nothing but Germany's downfall. \n\nHowever, there are still many Germans who cling to the idea of parties and parliament and would react strongly against the open dissolution of the parliament and removal of the last traces of the failed democracy.\n\nTo prevent nationwide riots and unrest, the Kaiser and his government have thus devised a series of new laws and regulations, which will allow us to completely bypass both the parliament and other democratic roadblocks while keeping up the facade of a democratic system."
 
 GER_Loyalty_to_the_Kaiser_and_the_Fatherland: "Loyalty to Kaiser and Fatherland!"
 GER_Loyalty_to_the_Kaiser_and_the_Fatherland_desc: "Germany is a land of multiple German backgrounds. Prussians, Bavarians, Swabians, Saxons and more all make up our great kingdom in Europe. However, many of these so-called 'Germans' have mixed loyalties, and don't even think of themselves as German! The Bavarian communists still strive for independence under socialism, and many others of the former kingdoms campaign for their kings and monarchies to be restored. As such, we have to integrate the country once more, just as Bismarck did during the Franco-Prussian War. Loyalty to Germany and the Kaiser must be implanted in the minds of every man & woman living in this great nation, and so we must begin preparations for multiple re-integration campaigns."

 GER_Crackdown_on_Foreign_Influence_desc: "For far too long German culture has been diluted by both foreign influences, whether it be movies from Hollywood, fashion trends from Paris, or Bolshevik agitation from Moscow, with otherwise decent Germans forgetting or forsaking their patriotic pride. \n\nTo combat this worrying trend, the government has decided to crack down on any type of foreign influence, whether it be cultural, political or scientific in nature, while also installing designated government agencies which from now on will dedicate themselves to repairing the damage which already has been done.\n\nWhile this measure is unpopular with both the populace and most foreign powers, it will greatly help us rally the German populace against any foreign foe."

Hugenberg's plan to assist the farmers in creating profitable small businesses shall be put into action.\n\nThe plan details seizing non-profitable government land and handing it over to small farmers - inciting an entrepreneurial spirit in those who receive the land and creating a community of business owners opposed to the everpresent Marxist forces that continue to lead the lower classes away from the light of traditional German values. The macroeconomic effect of this will be magnificent - more primary jobs for the lower-class and an increase in efficiency for the German economy."
 
 GER_Total_Protectionism: "Total Protectionism"
 GER_Total_Protectionism_desc: "If the last few years have taught Germany anything, it is that we cannot rely on other nations for trade and commerce. This reliance over the second decade of this century led to the suffering of the German Volk following the Wall Street Crash - the effects of which are still ongoing.\n\nWe must protect our industries by any means necessary to prevent a repeat of this disaster, even if this means applying such massive tariffs on targeted imports that no one wishes to contest German products on the internal market. By doing this, we guarantee that our industries thrive within our borders - no German worker will have to contest with the sweatshops of India, China or Japan for their products to sell.

 GER_Subsidize_Innovative_Buisnesses_desc: "During the glory days of the old Kaiserreich Germany experienced an economic boom the so-called Gründerzeit during which an unprecedented amount of business, whether they be small or gigantic, was founded, with an extremely positive effect on the economy. These times, however, ended rather quickly, when the subsidies financed by french war reparations were cut.\n\nNevertheless, the Kaiser and his government have recognized that the key to Germany's success in these times was the willingness of the government to subsidize and support businesses, which were daring enough to advance the technological advance of Germany, with groundbreaking inventions and innovative new production methods. The government has thus decided that from now every company that is willing to take the risk of innovation or has already implemented simple measures, instead of relying on proven methods, will be subsidized with government funds, regardless of the size and financial status of the company.\n\nThese measures are an almost foolproof, albeit rather expensive, way to ensure that the German industry will remain one of the most advanced in the world, while also improving our economy at a steady pace."

 GER_Limit_Imports_desc: "While the last few years have taught us that over-reliance on international trade can bring a heavy toll on all nations involved, it would be insane to restrict our economy to purely internal trade as some hardliners have suggested. Instead, we propose a limited export scheme - we only sell what is spare, and buy what we need. Nothing more, nothing less - we do not rely upon, we merely subsist. German companies are permitted to trade where they please, provided they meet a certain internal market quota.\n\nOur industries will be able to thrive without the overwhelming presence of foreign industries, built off the back of sweatshops that no normal and humane company could hope to compete in price and output. We will not compromise the quality of life of the German worker to get a higher number on our GDP. Gone are the days of materialism - Germany no longer serves the dollar, but the Kaiser!"

Through a complex plan of providing subsidies for small arms manufacturers and cheap government contracts for large companies willing to meet the high quotas required for German arms production, we will heighten the production of the materials required for war. Guns, bullets, grenades, rations, and clothes - no matter what it is, if you can make it and you are willing to take the subsidies, your means of production shall be put to work. No man shall be without equipment, no soldier without a good Stahlhelm, and each shall have a truck supplying them, day after day.\n\nThis heightened war production is sure to be noticed by our enemies, but we are sure to produce equipment much faster than we would otherwise. The Kaiser's armed forces will be prepared to march once more, and no matter who they face, victory will be assured.

Now we must rebuild Germany's economy to shine in the new Kaiserreich.\n\nThe Kaiser’s economic advisors suggest building civilian and military factories that will be headed by Junkers loyal to the Kaiserreich. This will spur the economy into its pre-war greatness by providing jobs and a source of income for the German people. The plan also covers infrastructure, with the goal of increasing Germany’s rail network and the Autobahn to further increase the German economy and tie the nation together with road and rail.

 # Restoring the Kaiserreich Event Chain
 GER_OKH.1.t: "Restoring the Kaiserreich?"
 GER_OKH.1.d: "With the rule of the Nazi menace at an end, and the Wehrmacht ruling the nation with an iron fist, it is high time to consider the future of our glorious nation. Currently, our military leaders have flocked to the concept of “Restoring the Kaiserreich”, citing the very successes our nation has undergone due to this, from our rapid industrialization into a global power, with the largest standing military. While it is reasonable to restore the Kaiserreich, we are faced with a question of our own, who will be the rightful inheritor to the throne? We are faced with 2 options; Wilhelm the 2nd, the last Kaiser of Germany who’s currently residing in the Netherlands, or Wilhelm, the Crown Prince of Germany who’s directing the next heir to the House of Hohenzollern, making him Kaiser. The Crown Prince is most certainly the easiest one, for he is in German soil and is very hands-on in terms of politics, making him a suitable candidate. However, Wilhelm the 2nd is still the rightful heir to the throne, but he’s currently in exile to the Netherlands, and it is difficult sending him here. We can only choose one, and both of them have drastic policies on how to rule Germany, so we must tread carefully."
 GER_OKH.1.A: "We shall meet with the Crown Prince"
 GER_OKH.1.A.tt: "§YThis will unlock the path for Wilhelm III§!\n"
 GER_OKH.1.B: "We shall send a letter to the Kaiser in Holland"
 GER_OKH.1.B.tt: "§YThis will unlock the path for Wilhelm II§!\n"

 GER_OKH.2.t: "Meeting with the Crown Prince"
 GER_OKH.2.d: "It was a quiet evening in Berlin that day, when Wilhelm, the Crown Prince of Germany was suddenly summoned by the new provisional government to discuss the fate of his country. He was excited and surprised, for he can finally claim his birthright as the ruler of Germany. When both Ludwig and Wilhelm met, it was if they were longtime friends, sharing ideas and informal conversations with each other, something no one has ever experienced. In their final hours of the meeting, Ludwig gave the offer Wilhelm was eager to accept, to be the next Kaiser of Germany. As expected, he took the offer and eagerly planned the next stage of events in his coronation planning."
 GER_OKH.2.A: "As expected, he took the offer"

 GER_OKH.3.t: "The Coronation"
 GER_OKH.3.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]After weeks of preparation, planning, decorating the venue, and overall funding the event, it is time to finally show the world we have a new ruler, a new Kaiser. The Crown Prince, Wilhelm, walks slowly to his newly created throne, personally developed by the provisional government, filled with jewels and created by some of the most finest and most valuable materials in the world, while the people cheer at his coronation. It was an event that was shown not only in Berlin, but throughout the world, sending a clear message to everyone that the House of Hohenzollern are back once more like the true masters of Germany. In his privileged speech, the newly coronated Kaiser Wilhelm III pledged to the German people, that no longer shall they be exploited or manipulated by both foreign powers and ambitious, self-righteous people of our empire. He called for stability, national unity, and revitalized nationalism, for the Kaiser himself has set off a chain of events that may redefine the European landscape forever, but for now, he has already sent a clear message to the nations of Europe, that the German Empire is once more standing as a regional power, and potentially a global one."
 GER_OKH.3.A: "The Kaiserreich Stands Strong!"

 GER_OKH.4.t: "Letter of Reconciliation"
 GER_OKH.4.d: "Ever since the Wehrmacht leadership have chosen Kaiser Wilhelm II as the new Kaiser, mostly due to the fact that we maintain de facto control over Germany, we have exchanged letters between both our government and the Kaiser, who’s currently living in the Netherlands in a self-proclaimed exile. He was, confused, to say the least. After all, the government before him was recently overthrown and had bitter distress with the former Kaiser, who they blamed as one of the major factors in the country’s downfall, and he felt that he was once more being used to seize power within Germany. As such, his replies were always hesitant, fearing that, nevertheless, after a handful of letters, Kaiser Wilhelm II has finally accepted the offer made by the provisional government, his reinstatement to the throne of Kaiser, his final wish before he may see his demise, for which we know no date."
 GER_OKH.4.A: "The Kaiser finally came to his senses"

 GER_OKH.5.t: "The Exiled Kaiser"
 GER_OKH.5.d: "With the Kaiser fully on board with our plan to reinstate himself and his family to the throne, we still face one little roadblock, the Netherlands itself. The politicians in Amsterdam believe that the Kaiser is under a much greater threat should it go back to Germany, for they believe that we may use him for more “ulterior motives”, not mentioning the strong, neutral stance that this nation to our West takes. This excuse is nothing more than a blatant attempt on extracting concessions from the return of the Kaiser, and as such, they’ve blocked all means to extradite him back to his homeland. \nAs such, the leadership has proposed three various options as to how to deal with this. \nOne, we simply give an ultimatum, demanding the return of the Kaiser or face potential war. However, while this is the simplest way to return the Kaiser, not to mention the easiest, should we go to war with them, we may face intervention by the Western powers. \nAlternatively, we can concede to their demands, give guarantees on their sovereignty and such. However, is it really worth it to protect the sovereignty of a small nation like Holland? Not to mention the potential consequences of bowing down to a small nation like them. \nFinally, we have a more discreet option, we shall create a rescue operation to secretly send the Kaiser back into Germany, since relying on Diplomacy requires us to give concessions, while the military risks escalation, hence removing those variables out of the table. Of course, this operation will not only take extensive amounts of effort but also extensive amounts of risk. If we fail, we will face backlash and potential Allied intervention. \n\nNevertheless, the options are presented, and only one of them will be the most optimal to bring our Kaiser home."
 GER_OKH.5.A: "Grant the Concessions"
 GER_OKH.5.A.tt: "§GWe shall stick to Diplomacy and not risk escalation§!"
 GER_OKH.5.B: "Send the Ultimatum!"
 GER_OKH.5.B.tt: "§RThey shall see the full might of the Wehrmacht!§!"
 GER_OKH.5.C: "Sneak our Kaiser out of there!"
 GER_OKH.5.C.tt: "§HDiplomatic and Military Solutions are overrated§!"

 GER_OKH.6.t: "Preparation: Cover Story"
 GER_OKH.6.d: "With much surprise, the leadership in Berlin has deduced that diplomacy and military are not viable options, and that only through secure and extraction operations are the only ways to bring back our glorious Kaiser to his homeland. The operation, named Unternehmen Wilhelm and led by Wilhelm Canaris, chief of the Abwehr, This operation is considered the riskiest and most valuable operation our government has ever faced. As part of our preparations for this highly important operation, we must determine our cover story, for it will help us in the future. We could pose as simply tourists, visiting the Netherlands for a couple of days. However, we must consider that we’re bringing the Kaiser with us, and while we can forge a passport for him, it is quite hard considering that the Netherlands has placed important steps to ensure his extradition will not come without their consent. Alternatively, we can pose as doctors in a medical mission, where we can safely transport the Kaiser in our transports as we can simply state that we are sending patients to Berlin for the finest medical treatment. However, they may ask us questions regarding our field work, and with the lack of proficiency in complex medical terms, we may be arrested for falsifying records and potentially espionage if our cover is blown. The choice is yours, but it will affect you later."
 GER_OKH.6.A: "I heard Rotterdam is lovely this time of year"
 GER_OKH.6.B: "We need to help the critically injured and terminally ill"

 GER_OKH.7.t: "Preparation: Entry Point"
 GER_OKH.7.d: "As we’ve already finalized our cover story, we must decide on our entry point, also detrimental to our operation. There are 3 obvious options that we can use: Land, Sea, or Air. Land, through the border between our 2 nations is the easiest of the three, as the borders, while regulated, is still cheaper than the other 2. However, should we leave a bad impression of ourselves at the border, we may find it more difficult to go back home. Sea is also an option, through the various ports within the Netherlands, an important aspect of their economy. Finally, we have air, through the airports in the Netherlands. While the final 2 are seemingly viable options, both have not only the same problem as the border method, but also a different problem, time. The latter 2 options utilize entry points that are farther from the residence of the Kaiser. Since time is an important factor, it is important to consider if those 2 are really options to consider. Once more, the choice is yours."
 GER_OKH.7.A: "Land is the cheaper and faster option"
 GER_OKH.7.B: "I’ve always wanted to ride a ship"
 GER_OKH.7.C: "The advancements in aviation will bring our Kaiser home"

 GER_OKH.8.t: "Entering the Kaiser’s Residence"
 GER_OKH.8.d: "The immigration process went off without a hitch, the officers believed our cover story, and let us through without any problems whatsoever. With that conundrum out of the way, we shall commence the operation. We did recon on the residence, and it is guarded by armed personnel who look Dutch in appearance, who have their hands on the trigger, ready to fire. We decided to take a stealthier approach, through the back. We entered the residence, but we may have awakened the Kaiser too soon. He shouted, “Who’s there?”, but for the sake of confidentiality, we can’t respond until it is confirmed its him. He shouted again, this time with anger, “Who’s there?! If you do not respond, I will call the guards outside.” Left with no choice, we said our identity to him, and thankfully, it is him. “Mein Gott, my rescue team is finally here!”, he said to us, and we escorted him stealthy out of the residence to a nearby hotel. Now, we are left with one more conundrum and we can safely say mission accomplished, the border checkpoint."
 GER_OKH.8.A: "Thank god this didn’t end up badly"

 GER_OKH.9.t: "The Border Checkpoint"
 GER_OKH.9.d: "With the Kaiser secured and our team still intact, we face the biggest obstacle in our mission, the border checkpoint. As the Kaiser is very well known amongst the more wealthy sectors of the Dutch society, it is impractical that we transport him by sea or air, for he would be easily spotted by the passengers and call up the police. As such, we’ve decided to transport the Kaiser by road, through the border checkpoint where it will be easier for us to transport him. However, the immigration center is very rigorous, with officers known to throw people off their questions to check if they are giving out factual information. We must be careful on their questions, for if we fail, it will end up bloody for us."
 GER_OKH.9.A: "Tread carefully everyone, we will be fine"

 GER_OKH.10.t: "First Question: What’s your purpose in visiting Netherlands?"
 GER_OKH.10.d: "The border officer came to us, slowly and armed with his rifle. He greeted us nicely, using his rough German knowledge to question us. His first question was the purpose of our visit in the Netherlands? We answered confidently and said…"
 GER_OKH.10.A: "Vacation"
 GER_OKH.10.B: "Medical Mission to the Netherlands from Germany"

 GER_OKH.11.t: "Second Question: Where did you go exactly?"
 GER_OKH.11.d: "The officer was delighted to see tourists come around his fine country. After all, it has large amounts of historical significance and tourist destinations. The officer, curious to know where they went, asked what place did they actually go?"
 GER_OKH.11.A: "We went to Rotterdam, it’s a lovely place"
 GER_OKH.11.B: "Why, Nuremberg is beautiful"

 GER_OKH.12.t: "Second Question: Do you have any patients with you?"
 GER_OKH.12.d: "The officer was delighted when hearing that doctors from Berlin came to his country, even though they aren’t in a friendly state. He stated that doctors from Germany are some of the finest in the world, and that he was treated by one. Anyways, the officer asked if we had any other patients with us, and if we had documents for them. We said that…"
 GER_OKH.12.A: "Yes we do, he’s sedated at the moment but here are his travel papers"
 GER_OKH.12.B: "We do not have any patients with us"

 GER_OKH.13.t: "Shootout in Border Checkpoint"
 GER_OKH.13.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]After verifying the papers and inspecting the vehicle, the officers were alerted that we aren’t who we say we are, and that we should get out of the car. Due to our precarious position, we had no choice but to open fire at the border guards, leaving us in a firefight. We exchanged fire from both sides, with casualties on both sides. In the chaos, it was found out that Kaiser Wilhelm II died during the fight, one of the first blood as seen from the trajectory of the bullets and the estimated time of death. As a result, the Wehrmacht leadership disavowed the operation, purging its participants, and declared a state of mourning in Germany. Now, without a Kaiser, it is natural that we request Prince Wilhelm to become the next Kaiser."
 GER_OKH.13.A: "This never should’ve happened..."

 GER_OKH.14.t: "Return of Kaiser Wilhelm II"
 GER_OKH.14.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]After verifying the papers and inspecting the vehicle, they concluded that we are regular citizens of Germany, and that there is no red flag of any sort. This means that the Kaiser has safely returned to Germany without any hitches whatsoever. At midnight in Berlin, he and the rest of the Wehrmacht leadership continued planning for the next stage, announcing his return. At noon, the world was shocked at hearing the Kaiser’s voice for the first time on German radio… “My fellow countrymen, I have spent my entire time in Holland thinking about Germany, specifically its people. I have seen first hand the marvels of my citizens, who fought gallantly in the Weltkrieg that has engulfed the world. However, my throne merely locked me out, forcing me to pander to the corrupt institutions and factions within our glorious army, who exploited my weakness to control Germany with an iron fist. Now, as I come back to my homeland, I shall pledge that we, as Germans, and as your Kaiser, that we will no longer be the laughing stock of Europe, and that we shall reclaim our destiny as the true masters of the world and bring about a new Germany, a new era, a Pax Germania! I assume that everyone must have questions, and that how am I talking to my fellow countrymen as of this very moment. It is due to the exemplary efforts of the Abwehr, who have fought tooth and nail to ensure my safe passage from Holland, who have unjustly used me as a bargaining chip, to my homeland, Germany. I hope that shall ease your minds on my sudden return.”"
 GER_OKH.14.A: "It was a long journey, but we can finally sleep peacefully at night"

 GER_OKH.15.t: "The Netherlands has accepted our concessions"
 GER_OKH.15.d: "With the secret negotiations between us and Holland regarding the future of Kaiser Wilhelm II, both our and their ministry of foreign affairs announced that the Kaiser will return to Germany. Coincidentally, an agreement has been published for distribution within hours after said transfer. It stated that Germany, in its commitment to “protect its allies”, will declare defend the small nation of Netherlands from various threats it may be presented, in an effort to “protect small nations from the aggression of larger nations”. While the press is dissecting the agreement as we speak, it isn’t of importance, as everyone is invested in the Kaiser’s return home. Already, thousands of Germans were already lining up the roads towards Berlin, upon which the Kaiser gave a speech in front of the Reichstag, broadcast throughout the world much like how the Wehrmacht did… “My fellow countrymen, I have spent my entire time in Holland thinking about Germany, specifically its people. I have seen first hand the marvels of my citizens, who fought gallantly in the Weltkrieg that has engulfed the world. However, my throne merely locked me out, forcing me to pander to the corrupt institutions and factions within our glorious army, who exploited my weakness to control Germany with an iron fist. Now, as I come back to my homeland, I shall pledge that we, as Germans, and as your Kaiser, that we will no longer be the laughing stock of Europe, and that we shall reclaim our destiny as the true masters of the world and bring about a new Germany, a new era, a Pax Germania!"
 GER_OKH.15.A: "This better be worth it, otherwise, it's all for nothing.."

 GER_OKH.16.t: "The Netherlands Acquiesced to our Demands"
 GER_OKH.16.d: "Mere days after we’ve sent the ultimatum, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has announced that they will be accepting the extradition request of Kaiser Wilhelm II back to our nation. This informally confirms that the Netherlands have acquiesced to our demands, and have safely returned our Kaiser without any form of injury or any life-threatening condition. Already, thousands of Germans were already lining up the roads towards Berlin, upon which the Kaiser gave a speech in front of the Reichstag, broadcast throughout the world much like how the Wehrmacht did… “My fellow countrymen, I have spent my entire time in Holland thinking about Germany, specifically its people. I have seen first hand the marvels of my citizens, who fought gallantly in the Weltkrieg that has engulfed the world.

 GER_OKH.16.A: "The old man surely can make a fiery speech"

 GER_OKH.17.t: "The Netherlands Ignored our Ultimatum"
 GER_OKH.17.d: "The Netherlands, in what seems to be a rather foolish decision, outright ignored our ultimatum, in what seems to be a futile effort to show strength against us, again a rather foolish move on their part. Currently, we have two options for engagement. One, we simply back down and pretend that we never made such an agreement, leaving Wilhelm stuck in Holland while we use our alternative option. Or, we can uphold the ultimatum, declaring war on the Netherlands, occupying the nation until they agree to our demands. The first option, while plausible, already endangers the relationship between the Kaiser and our provisional government, a relationship that we can’t afford to lose. Along with this, it will show weakness in our part, for the Netherlands is a small nation, and if we back down, it shows that Germany isn’t in a position to make demands, endangering our diplomatic reputation. However, if we escalate this to a military conflict, we can see obvious intervention by France and Britain, since we’ve literally invaded a sovereign nation for their unwillingness to cooperate on the return of a Kaiser who has been waiting for justice in Entente courts for decades. We must decide carefully, for the consequences may be too great."
 GER_OKH.17.A: "We cannot risk war with the Allies, we must back down"
 GER_OKH.17.B: "How dare they ignore us! They shall see the full might of the Wehrmacht!"
