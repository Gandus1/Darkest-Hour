 GER_Establish_The_Gestapo_desc: "As our Reich consolidates power in Germany, we must remember that radical organizations, from the reactionaries to the communist revolutionaries, all want an end to our newly bred rule. They see our Reich as a living embodiment of what they abhor, and our so-called “warmongering” stance on our foreign policy has allowed our adversaries to invest heavily into these factions, hoping for an end to German revanchism. We cannot and will not allow such activities to hold a single stronghold, regardless whether it be in the most isolated pockets of our territories, to Berlin itself. We must establish a Secret Police, called the Gestapo, to not only deal with adversaries at home but to influence foreign governments abroad, paving the way for a smooth transition of power once we reach their homelands. All shall remember, that the Reich isn’t some pushover that’s easily unstable. On the contrary, our adversaries are everything that they call us…"

 GER_Oberkommando_Putsch_desc: "The Führer, Adolf Hitler, has gone too far. We’ve given him a chance to prove his worth, and so far he has exceeded our expectations. However, his pride, stubbornness, and overall stupidity have already affected his leadership, with talks of remilitarizing the Rhineland, an act that will meet overwhelming backlash with the great powers of Europe, eventually bringing us again to another war that will bring the downfall of Germany. We’re still facing the inherent issues created in the aftermath of the World War, now Hitler intends to bring us into a second one? It is time that we end Hitler’s reign of terror throughout Germany and establish a transitory government that will decide the future of Germany. This coup d'état will be bloody, and we may face a civil war at our hands, but the so-called thousand-year-old Reich won’t even last a thousand weeks if we bring ourselves into war, regardless if we achieve victory or not."

 GER_Volksgemeinschaft: "Volksgemeinschaft"
 GER_Volksgemeinschaft_desc: "Throughout history there have been many divides between the German people: classes and nobility have greatly stained German society in the past, even though those divides are but imaginary.\nAs National Socialism teaches us, there is only one divide in the world, only one thing that separates humanity: race and the eternal war of the races.\nBy following the teachings of our Führer and the party and realizing this, the German people will find new sociability, learn to embrace and accept each other and unite against their common enemy: the lesser subhuman races that threaten the rule of the master-race.\nThe new Volksgemeinschaft found by our people will greatly help us in fighting these races and secure the thousand-year rule of the Reich."

 GER_Reichssicherheitsamt: "Reichssicherheitsamt"
 GER_Reichssicherheitsamt_desc: "The protector of the Reich, both at home and abroad, the Reichssicherheitshauptamt or the Reich Main Security Office houses all intelligence agencies and internal security forces of the SS. Governed directly by the Reichsführer-SS, the Reich Main Security Office sole objective is the security of the Reich, both internally and externally. As such, it comprised a variety of tasks, from simple administrative and legal work of the SS, to Foreign Intelligence Services and Suppression of both foreign culture and dissent. Its most infamous child agency, the Gestapo, is highly regarded in its efforts to suppress and purge dissent, “disappearances” of prominent opposition leaders, and the extermination of “undesirables” within the Reich itself."

 GER_Arbeitseinsatz: "Arbeitseinsatz"
 GER_Arbeitseinsatz_desc: "Our society and economy is in dire need for workers. This labour shortage can be easily solved by forcing citizens from occupied countries to work in our factories, communities, and farms. In 1945 some 7.7 million non-German workers were forced to participate in Germany's economy."

 GER_Madagaskar_Plan: "Madagaskar Plan"
 GER_Madagaskar_Plan_desc: "Shortly before the fall of France in 1940, German officials called for the resettlement of Jews as far away from Europe as possible. The proposal called for the handing over of control of Madagascar to Germany as part of the French surrender terms. According to plans made by Adolf Eichmann, a million Jews would be settle in Madagascar, with the SS governing the island as a police state."

 GER_Generalplan_Ost: "Generalplan Ost"
 GER_Generalplan_Ost_desc: "With Heim ins Reich successful and all Aryans united once more under our banner, we shall look towards the east, the Soviet Union, as our next victim in our goal for Lebensraum. For too long, the Soviets have been a thorn on our side, countering our ambitions for expansion eastward towards the Baltics and the Balkans. Their ideology of Communism is the epitome of everything we abhor, clinging on such a false truth of liberating the worker, while they themselves are the ones who oppress the common man into their own image. It is time that we bring down our greatest adversary in Europe, and liberate their people from the yolk of Communism once and for all."

 GER_Waffen_SS_desc: "A direct descendant of the SS Dispositional Troops, the Waffen-SS is the official combat arm of the Schutzstaffel, with its predecessor dissolved and reorganised to meet the changing landscape of warfare in Europe. The Waffen-SS, unlike the SS Dispositional Troops, are controlled by both the OKW, the Reichsführer-SS, and the Führer himself. They are also comprised of foreign legionnaires, citizens from outside of the Reich’s nominal borders but loyal to our cause. Of course, we only choose the cream of the crop from these foreigners, as the security of the Reich and its cause depends on it. We are, after all, the tip of the spear, the apex of a soldier in the Reich, with its most important leaders, especially our glorious Führer, depending on our success in the battlefield."

 GER_Enforce_Strict_Purity_Requirements_desc: "As the horizons and resources of the Waffen-SS expand, so do its prospects for an increase in recruitment. Part of this process has already begun, and there should be nothing wrong with an expansion of the SS. It is not hard to find happy citizens whispering that National Socialism will never meet a finer force of radical Nazis. Except that this may no longer be the case.\n\nMany of the men recruited into the Waffen-SS are not of true Aryan descent. Some are only of Germanic heritage, including foreign volunteers. And of course, they cannot have the same loyalty to the Fatherland as any other of our warriors. As a result, limited spaces in the Waffen-SS are filled up by undesirables from other nations, who likely share no patriotism for Germany.\n\nA new policy must be enforced: We can no longer tolerate these 'unpure' soldiers. From now on, only the ones that match racial purity and physical ability requirements will be allowed to join the prestigious Waffen-SS. This will guarantee their place as a fanatical fighting force, a beacon of true German pride for all others to admire!"

 GER_SS_Panzer_Units: "SS-Panzertruppen"
 GER_SS_Panzer_Units_desc: "The Waffen-SS has proved its prowess on the battlefield due to the highly resilient nature of these elite troops. Now, the evolving nature of warfare in Europe insists that we begin a transition into Panzergrenadier and Panzer divisions.\n\nThere is no question of whether our SS men deserve this upgrade. There are no soldiers finer both in their fighting ability and fanaticism than those of the Waffen-SS. Should this proposal be carried out, several SS divisions will be redirected to the homeland and temporarily relieved of active duty until the new mobile units have been fully reorganised.\n\nUpgrading existing units and recruiting new ones will be a tremendous drain of our current stockpile and production capacity. Even assembling a quarter of the divisions that the SS plans to raise will prove difficult. It is an expensive decision, one that must ultimately be made by the Führer.\n\nIf he does decide to allow the changes, it will be the best choice for the Reich. The Waffen-SS will serve us with all the effort they can muster!"

It only makes sense to isolate the cream of the crop to form our Special forces, acclimatized in all terrains, ready for all manners of operations, be it aerial assaults or amphibious operations, the SS troops seem to be the most appropriate and fit for such physically taxing and difficult tasks. With the necessary approval from the party apparatus, it has been decided to aggressively expand the naval troop training establishment in Swinemünde and to adapt Luftwaffe Fallschirmschule Nr. 3 to accommodate personnel and train them to the highest standards, to form elite Marinestoßtruppen and Fallschirmjäger units of the Waffen-SS."

 GER_Divisionen_der_SS_desc: "These are desperate times, times that will test the European civilization, failure will result in decadent Bolsheviks taking over, while we have much to gain, we have everything to lose. In his latest directive the Reichsführer-SS has approved the recruitment of combat personnel from foreign territories, particularly from the eastern ones, with many from a questionable racial profile to say the very least. Despite protests from some of the more traditionalists of the SS, many understand the need for all the manpower we can get to face the Bolshevik “hordes”, to dissuade fears that these new personnel will be part of the SS, they will serve in Divisions, which are simply under the disposition of the Waffen-SS, rather than Waffen-SS Divisions."

 GER_Recruit_from_the_Wehrmacht: "Recruit from the Wehrmacht"
 GER_Recruit_from_the_Wehrmacht_desc: "Focus within the Waffen-SS has turned to the maintenance of its high standards in recruitment. The search for worthy new members is becoming more difficult, simply because the most patriotic of our fighters are already serving in the Waffen-SS. The SS leadership turns to the Führer himself with a contentious request: they wish for permission to turn to the army and pick out the apex of their warriors. It makes sense if the SS is to remain the elite of the elite.\n\nThe biggest objection to this request comes from Oberkommando Wehrmacht, who were outspoken several times during the establishment Waffen-SS. OKW already seethes with frustration, and continuing to anger them by giving priority to the SS divisions may just be lighting up their fury. We can be certain that whatever side we appease, the other will react extremely negatively.\n\nIt is time to address this proposal formally and negotiate a compromise between the two factions. It certainly makes sense to give the SS a larger manpower pool, but OKW refuses to allow it. The Führer's judgment will be the decisive factor."

There are hundreds of thousands of men in other countries willing to fight for the National Socialist cause; to fight for the truth of the world above all else, rejecting the falsehoods of the modern world with force. We could take advantage of this by launching SS recruitment campaigns in our occupied territories, allowing us to set up SS-Freiwilligen Divisionen - SS Volunteer Divisions, that serve in the name of their respective lands, fighting for and protecting them through serving in the German Army. We are confident that the spirit of any true National Socialist is as strong as any other - and even if that isn't the case, an elite soldier is an elite soldier - still an asset worth having in the SS."

 GER_Heer: "§aThe Heer§!"
 GER_Heer_desc: "With the rearmament going faster than even we had anticipated, we must now decide which direction the new Wehrmacht should take. Should we build and improve upon what we learned during the Weltkrieg? Could our successes in the Kaiserschlacht maybe be our prime indicator of how we should fight in modern war? Or should we listen to the new ideas of Generals Guderian and Lutz, who think that the Panzer is the future and the key to revolutionizing modern warfare, emphasizing speed and mobility."

 GER_Achtung_Panzer: "Achtung - Panzer!"
 GER_Achtung_Panzer_desc: "German warfare has always been based around speed and mobility, quick wars and decisive victories. The Weltkrieg’s crippling trench warfare impaired our army and the German fighting spirit, but with new cutting-edge technologies such as better and faster Panzers and improved radios and with tactical pioneers such as Heinz Guderian and Erwin Rommel leading the helm, we finally have what we need to break through the trenches. We shall revolutionize modern warfare in a way that will see our enemies completely overwhelmed."

 GER_Panzerjager: "Panzerjäger"
 GER_Panzerjager_desc: "Our enemies have begun mastering the art of armored warfare, along with producing more advanced types of armored tanks. As such, it places us in a difficult position to continue our Blitzkrieg throughout Europe and beyond. As such, we must learn to not only counter their newly created tanks, but reduce them to scrap metal. Henceforth, the Wehrmacht will be ordered to create a new branch of service overseen by the Heer, the Panzerjäger. Translated as “Armor-Hunters”, the Panzerjäger will be the anti-armored arm of our glorious armed forces. The general design will be that an anti-tank weapon will be mounted along with a weapon shield on a tracked chassis, enabling it to deal maximum penetration while ensuring high mobility."

 GER_Panzergrenadiers: "Panzergrenadiers"
 GER_Panzergrenadiers_desc: "Bewegungskrieg is the center of our doctrine, the pinnacle of German strategy. However, tanks alone cannot break the front line. Our mobile force needs infantry to accompany them to secure sectors, defend the flanks and provide support. Recently, one of our generals has come up with an idea of how do deal with this. He says we should mechanize some of our troops, to allow them to keep up with the tanks, yet pack the same punch. He says we would call them Panzergrenadiers, and they would be an elite force of men. This idea has gathered support, and many are calling on us to agree."

 GER_Mannschaftstransportwagen: "Mannschaftstransportwagen"
 GER_Mannschaftstransportwagen_desc: "Modern war with its ever more devastating weapons is becoming hugely dangerous for infantry. Shrapnel, mines, artillery fire, not even our Panzergrenadiers can provide enough protection for our infantry anymore. This is why we have developed the first fully-tracked infantry vehicle of the Wehrmacht, the Kätzchen. Unlike the Panzergrenadiers, it will be fully on tracks and will have armour similar to that of a tank, almost looking like one and only missing the turret. With this newly acquired infantry fighting vehicle, we will be able to more effectively ensure the safe arrival of our infantry at the front lines and will make our assault even more powerful."

 GER_Entwicklung_Series: "Entwicklung Series"
 GER_Entwicklung_Series_desc: "While our medium and heavy Panzers are some of the if not the best tanks in the world, it is becoming apparent that they’re not ideal. Slowly but surely their deficits are becoming clearer, yet the problem does not lie in the model, but in the concept: through the course of the war and the development of modern warfare, the concept of light, medium and heavy tanks has become more and more outdated, which is why we have tasked our engineers to reinvent the modern tank and they gave us the Entwicklung Series or E-Serie. These Panzers, of which the first model will be the E-50, will be new standardized tanks, which means that every Panzer of the E-Serie will have interchangeable parts, so they can be repaired and built more easily, which will greatly increase their reliability and production efficiency and thus will be better adapted to modern warfare and the challenges it brings. They will serve as the main Panzers of the entire army. Our enemies might think that we will just rest on the laurels of our past achievements and innovations, but once the E-Serie rolls over their troops they will know just how wrong they were."

 GER_Kriegsmarine: "§3The Kriegsmarine§!"
 GER_Kriegsmarine_desc: "Over twenty years ago the German fleet was the pride of our nation: We had the biggest and strongest ships and an expansive home and colonial fleet that was able to pose a real danger to the Royal Navy. But, due to our losses in the Weltkrieg and the crippling Treaty of Versailles, our fleet is a far cry from what it used to be. It’s time to change that: Since the rearmament began our fleet has been growing steadily as well, but the real expansion of the Kriegsmarine has just begun. Many of our admirals such as Erich Raeder dream of a grand German armada, one day eclipsing established fleets such as the Royal or US Navy, while others such as Karl Dönitz think more practical and want to work and improve on what we have, leaving wild dreams and future plans for tomorrow. Choosing one of these paths will be crucial but building up our fleet will be no easy task and will take a lot of time and resources. In the end, though, we will have what we once used to and go even beyond that and make the Kriegsmarine the greatest fleet in the world."

 GER_Unterseeboot: "U-Boot"
 GER_Unterseeboot_desc: "Admiral Karl Dönitz has requested the production of 300 submarines, a quite unreasonable request at first glance but upon hearing Dönitz’ plans and ideas, focusing on the U-Boot seems like probably the best choice: The Kriegsmarine is still young and low on numbers, meanwhile building capital ships is quite expensive and time-consuming. Not so with submarines. They are relatively fast to build and low on cost. In contrast, their tactical and strategic potential is astonishing: Admiral Dönitz has noted that many of our enemy’s fleets, especially the Royal Navy, lack submarines and are not prepared for facing a large amount of them, meaning that using them to sink their convoys will be quite easy and with a large enough amount even their large capital ship fleets will be hugely endangered. Our enemies think that their capital ships are unbeatable and their fleets are decades ahead of the Kriegsmarine, but they will have a shrewd awakening once facing our grand U-Boot armada and realize that their hubris will lead to their doom."

 GER_Schwerer_Kreuzer: "Schwerer Kreuzer"
 GER_Schwerer_Kreuzer_desc: "The Treaty of Versailles restricts our navy to the point that we can’t build ships exceeding 10,000 tons to replace our outdated battleships. This badly cripples our ability to combat the +35,000 ton vessels our rivals are building. The idea of a “Panzerschiffe” or heavily armed cruiser seeks to solve this problem. These ships hold guns large enough to fight battleships, while still keeping their weight below the tonnage limit. While especially the armor of these ships suffers from all the weight the guns are taking up, as long as we are restricted to this tonnage these ships will be our best shot at combating our rivals naval power."

 GER_Seek_a_Naval_Agreement_with_Britain: "Seek a Naval Agreement with Britain"
 GER_Seek_a_Naval_Agreement_with_Britain_desc: "The Kriegsmarine has expanded at a rate unmatched by any navy in the world. Our tonnage has increased dramatically throughout the years. However, if we continue on our path, the British will take notice of the naval expansion. Therefore, a treaty with Britain to renegotiate our allowed tonnage must be put at the forefront of our diplomatic agenda.\nWhilst the British may have the most amount of capital ships in the world, they have informed us that if we continue on our rapid naval program, any attempt to renegotiate any such naval treaty will fall on deaf ears. As such, we must make concessions at the conference to the Royal Navy, but judging by the weak facade that the British government props up about ‘holding back the Germans from European domination’, our demands will easily be forced through. For the Kriegsmarine!"

 GER_Plan_U: "Plan U"
 GER_Plan_Z_desc: "The Kriegsmarine, as much as we do not like to admit it, is no match to the naval powers of Great Britain and her allies, as their so called “Naval Treaties” doesn’t just dismantle our own naval superiority, but strengthens their own navies, thereby crippling our naval capacity, and allowing another repeat of the World War, wherein Britain has starved us into signing a treaty that has humiliated Germany for decades. No longer, shall we be just the masters of the land, we shall be the masters of the sea. As such, our great thinkers in the Oberkommando der Marine have devised a plan known as “[ROOT.GetFocusName_GER_Plan_Z]”, the aggressive rearmament of our Kriegsmarine. A strict quota of ships from varying classes, from destroyers to battleships alike, will be established and if followed diligently, the world’s navies shall sink to the bottom of the sea, for the Kriegsmarine shall sail the oceans of the Earth, with nothing standing in its way."

 GER_UBoot_Cruisers: "U-Kreuzer"
 GER_UBoot_Cruisers_desc: "Until now our U-Boot were forced to stay close to our ports and their effectiveness in attacking enemy convoys was thus decreased. This is why we will bring a submarine type from the Weltkrieg back to life: The U-Kreuzer. Essentially a U-Boot but much bigger, with heavier guns and with even greater range. With the U-Kreuzer, we can attack trading fleets as far away as the mid-Atlantic and cut off our enemy’s supply lines where they’re the weakest. The new U-Kreuzers will be the height of German ship-engineering and be a powerful addition to our already mighty submarine fleet."

 GER_Elektroboot: "Elektroboot"
 GER_Elektroboot_desc: "Cutting the life supply of the Allies in the Atlantic requires new sophisticated technology to combat the material superiority of the Allies in the sea. A revolutionary upgrade of our effective submarine weapon could give us the decisive edge to strangle the Allied supply lines. The Elektroboot project consists of a submarine capable of operating submerged in its entirety, rather than just to escape detection or launch an attack. Running on a mix of hydrogen peroxide and diesel engines to recharge the batteries, this new submarine is designed to work submerged underwater for extended periods. Featuring snorkel and an updated automatized weapon system, the Elektroboot will guarantee an absolute control of the ocean."

 GER_Flugzeugtrager: "Flugzeugträger"
 GER_Flugzeugtrager_desc: "The premier navies of the world, such as the Royal Navy or the Imperial Japanese Navy, utilize aircraft carriers to further spread their influence across the seas. Many in the Kriegsmarine believe that such a carrier is necessary.\n\nHowever many others, such as Herr Göring himself and the Luftwaffe, are not fond of the idea that the navy is given more access to researching into carrier-based fighters and bombers, as they believe that a pilot should always be from the Luftwaffe, and not any other service branch. Other such problems are our extreme inexperience in building such carriers, and the large clique of battleship admirals who demand that they are given precedence. Nevertheless, we shall push on with our research and development into what could become the key to our navy's supremacy.\n\nWir dienen Deutschland!"

 GER_Fleet_in_Being: "Präsenzflotte"
 GER_Fleet_in_Being_desc: "Our fleet has become such an enormous armada that its mere existence is enough to make our enemies tremble with fear. Its size, range and power have reached an almost mythical level, rivaling or maybe even surpassing that of the Royal Navy in its prime. This advantage allows us to implement the Präsenzflotte-doctrine. A fleet strategy which follows the ideas of the great war philosopher Sun Tzu, because with this approach we will win without a fight. Our ships will rarely leave their ports and only attack enemy fleets when they have overwhelming superiority and are guaranteed to win without sustaining notable damage. The presence of our fleet is enough to gain naval superiority, as the mere potential of our ships engaging the enemy suffices to make it not worth it for them to even attempt to enter our waters. The top priority of the Kriegsmarine will henceforth be preserving and expanding our own fleet instead of fighting that of our foes. "

 GER_Zukunftsflotte: "Zukunft der Kriegsmarine"
 GER_Zukunftsflotte_desc: "The first expansion of our fleet was a resounding success and we have learned many things throughout the many battles our ships have fought. It is now time to further expand the Kriegsmarine and build it up from a low-priority part of our nation to what it once was, to the pride of Germany. The Kriegsmarine shall become the mightiest fleet in the world and be as feared by sailors as a typhoon in September. Soon enough we will have to decide what sea the Kriegsmarine shall be most feared in and what ships it shall wield as its tools of might. "

 GER_Baltische_Flotte: "Baltische Flotte"
 GER_Baltische_Flotte_desc: "Instead of venturing out to the Atlantic, a far away ocean controlled by some of the greatest naval powers in the world, we shall focus on a sea that is close to us, has historically been sailed by Germans and has no noteworthy naval power near it. The Baltic sea is surrounded by weak nations and even weaker navies, things that are both estrange to us. Controlling it is of utmost importance for us and will keep resources from Scandinavia flooding in, hence why we must focus on ships best suited for it. We shall focus on destroyers and submarines in order to build a powerful Baltic fleet and make the Baltic sea an impenetrable German fortress."

 GER_Atlantische_Flotte: "Atlantikflotte"
 GER_Atlantische_Flotte_desc: "If we want to be recognized as a world power, we can’t keep playing in puddles like the Baltic sea and building fishing boats. No, we must set out to the Atlantic Ocean and we must conquer it in the name of the Führer and in the name of the Reich, so that no blockade and no foreign navies will ever threaten our people again. For that we will have to build a bigger fleet and not just larger in size, but we will need bigger, heavier and more destructive ships. Submarines are for cowards and destroyers are cannon fodder, what we need are ships that will make our enemies tremble before the Kriegsmarine and that will make them afraid of even the thought of facing us in battle. Cruisers, battleships and carries must be the future of the Kriegsmarine."

 GER_Luftwaffe: "§SThe Luftwaffe§!"
 GER_Luftwaffe_desc: "While air warfare was not that important in the Weltkrieg, with new plane models growing bigger and deadlier every year, all evidence suggests that it will play a crucial role in the wars to come. This is why a reorganization of our young albeit rapidly growing air force, the Luftwaffe, is solely needed. Until now the main focus was to build up a sizable air force without following a certain direction. But now, since it has reached a respectable size and war is approaching, greater and bolder steps must be taken. We must begin to build aircraft more efficiently and with more aim. Only with a well-organized and battle-ready Luftwaffe will we have what it takes to gain dominance in the skies."

Throughout the war they have proven to be quite effective, the things that hinder their success are usually their low equipment and their lack of motorization or armoured vehicles. Our new Luftlandetruppen will eliminate that weakness: With our large and improved transport planes and our sophisticated para shoots, we are now able to not only para drop soldiers but also vehicles and artillery. Essentially, we are able to drop entire armies out of the sky. This is a strategic advantage of massive scale, one that could change the course of the war. No longer will our troops be confined to the land, our enemies will have one direction more to deal with, as our armies won’t just come from the front, rear, left and right, but also from above."

 GER_Frontlinienflieger_desc: "The Wehrmacht is undoubtedly one of the, if not the greatest armies in history. Our enemies tremble even at the thought of facing us in the field, so it’s only logical that we should put all our resources into strengthening it even more, into making it truly unstoppable. That is why the Luftwaffe shall focus its efforts on the development of ground support doctrines and assist the Wehrmacht in every step of its way as it cuts through our enemies’ forces. The fact that the Hermann Göring, one of the most trusted friends of our Führer and head of the Luftwaffe, is also a big proponent of this plan makes this course of action even more obvious."

Our technology and scientific expertise is rivaled by no one in the entire world: All the British and Americans have are Jewish refugees, born and raised here in the Vaterland. But we don’t need them, in fact we’re better off without them. And we shall proof this once and for all here and now in this war. The weapons we shall build will be the greatest culmination of innovative genius and scientific expertise in world history. Panzers, heavier and more powerful than anything our enemies could ever hope to build, while still maintaining an astonishing amount of speed, great and devastating rockets that will traverse entire continents to strike our enemies where they’ll never see it coming and warplanes propelled by jet engines surpassing the speed of sound – With these tools of destruction we shall crush our enemies and defeat them in a manner more absolute and unadulterated than anything ever seen before in the history of war."

 GER_Uranprojekt: "Uranprojekt"
 GER_Uranprojekt_desc: "The latest accomplishments on the field of nuclear science and the potential they have of helping in the war effort has greatly peaked the interest of our Führer, and thus he has tasked Albert Speer with the installment of the Uranprojekt. The greatest physicists in Germany, Werner Heisenberg, Robert Döpel, Kurt Diebner and Paul Karteck, came together to find a use for nuclear technology that will benefit the Reich and the war. What they found is that using nuclear fission a bomb can be created that far eclipses all weapons ever built, ever imagined by man. This weapon, the Atombombe will have the power to wipe out entire cities in a few moments and make them inhospitable for decades to come. But we’re not the only ones with this knowledge, we know that the cursed Jews that have fled the Reich are researching the same weapon at this very moment somewhere abroad. A weapon such as this cannot fall into the false hands of our rotten and inferior enemies, it must be realized by us first. We must, we will be the first ones to realize the greatest weapon of history and we shall use it to annihilate our accursed enemies once and for all."

 GER_Jet_Engines_desc: "Now that von Ohain’s invention, the jet engine, will finally be put into practice and will elevate the next generation of German warplanes, we must decide what plane we should prioritize, which one should take to the skies first: The most obvious option is to prioritize the Me 262. Fighters have always been the backbone of any air force and equipping our fighters with jet engines will give us an important edge in air battles and would probably see greater damage to the enemy air force. On the other hand, we could leave that for later and focus more on the Ar 234 initially. Tactical bombers are the by far most versatile planes in our arsenal. They can support ground troops, attack enemy ships and because of their large range can even go on strategic bombing missions. Building more of these initially would make sure that our jets are getting use in almost all areas and that their benefit is felt on every battlefield."

 GER_Jet_Fighters: "Düsenjäger"
 GER_Jet_Fighters_desc: "Once again a new milestone in technology was set by a German, his name Hans Joachim Pabst von Ohain. He is the man that invented and developed the world’s first jet engine and his name is already famous amongst the ranks of the Luftwaffe. With his invention we can develop warplanes unlike the world has ever seen, planes that will come close to the speed of sound and that will strike fear into the hearts of our enemies. The dawn of a new era for air warfare has begun and soon the sky will be dominated by the Düsenjäger of the German Reich."

 GER_Vergeltungswaffen_desc: "Instead of fighting honourably on the field our enemies have resided in cowardly air bombing raids on our cities in order to defeat us. This effort, however, will prove to be futile as the wrath of the Reich will strike back twice as hard: With new cutting-edge technology, we were able to greatly enhance rockets, which thus far have only seen use in the artillery department. We are now able to build much bigger rockets with a massive range that can even reach the borders of space in order to find their way to our enemies. These new Vergeltungswaffen, in short V-Waffen, will essentially be flying bombs targeted at enemy cities. No pilot required and no counter to such a weapon exists thus far, meaning it is essentially the ultimate strategic bombing weapon and with further refinement and research there’s no telling how far they will fly, how precise they will strike and how destructive they will be."

 GER_Naval_Air_Effort_desc: "Unfortunately, navies take an exponentially longer time to build up than armies or air forces, which is why the Kriegsmarine is probably the weakest link in the mighty German military and one that can easily be exploited by our enemies. That is why we shall focus more of our resources on developing and constructing naval bombers. We will remind our enemies that the Luftwaffe rules all the skies, even those atop the sea, and we shall do that by building aircraft specially designed to attack their ships. One of those planes will be the Fw 200 Condor, a highly modern naval bomber that will leave our enemies confused when they ask themselves where all their ships went."

 GER_Marine_Luftwaffe: "Marine-Luftwaffe"
 GER_Marine_Luftwaffe_desc: "As the war in the sea is becoming more and more important, and aircraft are becoming ever more essential for our naval campaigns, procuring such aircraft for the Kriegsmarine has become a major priority. So, in order to guarantee that all our carriers are equipped with planes and enough naval bombers are at disposal to support all naval missions, we will open up a separate air force supervised and headed by the Kriegsmarine, the Marine-Luftwaffe. This new air force will focus only on naval aircraft and will ensure that all demands made by the Kriegsmarine are fulfilled, while our regular Luftwaffe can focus on supporting our armies and raiding our enemies. While splitting up the resources may prove to be a challenge at first, in the end, this will result in much higher efficiency in production and organization and will greatly strengthen the Kriegsmarine."

It is now time to put all the knowledge and experience we have gathered to use and apply it to refine our tactics and our approach in air warfare. Even the mighty Luftwaffe cannot stay where it is, it too must evolve. Soon our enemies will find that what they had been facing up until now was but the beginning of what we can bring to the skies and that the future Luftwaffe is even more terrifying than the one they know."

Such an act of economic exploitation can no longer be tolerated within the Reich. As such, we shall create the “Four Year Plan”, an economic plan that all stakeholders of our economy shall follow, or face severe repercussions.

All of these prove that our way of war was the right one and that our losses can only be attributed to our lack of capable allies and resources.

These units will reinforce our infantry and fill the holes that need to be filled in our army. Those who join these units will be revered as heroes of the Vaterland and will be sent to the frontline quicker and with a lesser amount of training but with the same or even better morale than our regular soldiers.

But unfortunately, we can’t use all of his ideas at once, as some of them collide with each other, so now we must choose which assault-tactics are best suited for the infantry platoons of the Wehrmacht. We could go with the Angriffskonzentration, in which the infantry should concentrate their attack on the enemy and act together in their way of assault. Or we drill our infantry to form Stoßtrupps if the situation allows it. This way of attack follows the fire-and-movement-principle (one part of the platoon moves forward, while the other part covers them) and guarantees that our soldiers are always covered during their advance."

It is vital that they stay together so that the effectiveness of their fire is at its highest and to ensure that they can’t get separated and finished off individually, thus increasing their chance of survival.

For this our platoons will be taught the “Feuer und Bewegung”- doctrine. With this, platoons aren’t just allowed to split up, they must. When encountering an enemy, they will split into two squads: One stays put and fires at the enemy, while the other moves forward, ideally trying to outflank them. After arriving at the target location, the advancing squad will halt and fire, so that the other squad move and can catch up. They will essentially switch roles over and over and keep moving, always covering each other, the platoon won’t be stationary but always mobile.

It is a historic day for our nation, who will finally see a golden age under his rule. His goals for uplifting German society and ambitions on Lebensraum has inspired the vast majority of the German people, who have been disgruntled by the elite who intend to sell this nation for their personal interests, most especially those animalistic Jews, the Communists who intend to break down the social order and replace it with a society that's inherently anti-German, and the politicians who exploit crises for their selfish intentions. With himself as Reichskanzler and his party, the NSDAP, in control of our nation’s politics, perhaps our destiny can finally be reclaimed, and peace can finally come in our time."

When the First Weltkrieg was lost, one of the conditions of the Treaty of Versailles was the reduction of our military, especially the army, which was reduced to the mandated 100,000. It was neutered under the years of the Weimar Republic, being unable to bring Germany to greatness. Instead it only served as a reminder of how weak we were, how we were at the whim of the Entente. Yet, under the guidance of our Führer, Adolf Hitler, we have a chance. A chance to rebuild not only our military, but our pride, our glory, and our right to exist. Yet we must bide our time, for we are not ready to take on the parasites of the West."

Such acts can’t go unpunished and must be purged from society immediately. While the Reichstag Fire Decree proved itself useful in that regard, it is still not enough. We currently are forced into a coalition with another political party, the German National People’s Party. While they are similar to our party and have the same political goals, they are wildcards, and we can’t afford to be under a political deadlock in a time when our nation needs quick, decisive action.\n\nAs such, we shall request the Reichstag to pass “The Enabling Act”. This piece of legislation will allow the German Cabinet, unanimously filled with our own party members, the ability to enact legislation without the consent of the Reichstag. This will allow us to implement our policies swiftly, efficiently, and decisively. If the Reichstag will not support this piece of legislation, we will “convince” them to support its enactment, regardless if they leave the building dead or alive."

This program will implement our Nazification policies throughout the Reich, allowing us to cleanse the people of their anti-German propaganda.

As such, the Nazi Revolution didn’t end when Hitler became Chancellor, and that the only way the Reich can fully achieve its revolution is through socialism. Of course, the politicians in Berlin would never accept such ideologies in the Reich, as the main purpose they are in power is to purge Socialism and other malcontents who seek to end our way of life.

Such acts of treason are not tolerated within the Reich, and must be purged immediately, with no exceptions, otherwise our nation will see a Civil War in its hands.

Such clauses were made by the reactionary West to dominate German affairs and prevent us from reclaiming our destiny as the masters of Europe, hiding behind the facade of “ensuring world peace and the end of conflict” while they themselves prop up their military industry to even greater heights.

The Anglo Naval superiority has only grown in proportion to our strength, it is likely that they will again cut off essential grain imports and material shipments. But while our future lies in the East, our present situation can also be helped by the East, the USSR to say in the simplest term is home to colossal amounts of raw materials that can feed our war machine and grain that can feed our population. It is only in our best interest, at least in the context of the near future to conclude a trade agreement with them as soon as possible. While the foreign ministry has already drafted an initial proposal, it will be highly likely that they will request various technologies in order to facilitate the trade agreement, an acceptable price for the acquisition of these vital resources"

Despite the heavy dissent within the Wehrmacht regarding the formation of the SS-VT, an early demonstration of the combat abilities of radical loyalists shows that an armed branch of the SS has its own merits. Now, the Reichsführer-SS proposes to expand this into a larger force.\n\nA direct descendant of the SS-VT, the Waffen-SS will be the official combat arm of the Schutzstaffel, with its predecessor dissolved and reorganized. The Waffen-SS will be controlled by the OKW, the Reichsführer-SS, and the Führer himself. The rapid formation of multiple SS units will proceed should the Führer provide his consent. We shall only choose the cream of the crop of our soldiers and paramilitary units, ensuring that the Waffen-SS remains unquestionably fanatical in their loyalty to the Führer, National Socialism, and the Vaterland.\n\nControversy is presented around this topic, however, and OKW has much objection to SS divisions not under their direct control. The SS-VT has already brought plenty of debate, and perhaps making it an official branch of the military may be too much.\n\nRegardless, we can be certain that the Waffen-SS will achieve well on the battlefield should we permit its creation.

However, make no mistake, it shouldn’t be underestimated as a minor wing in the SS. The Allgemeine-SS oversees the internal security of the Reich, purging dissent from within and silencing opposition through whatever means necessary through its secret police force, the Gestapo. Along with its internal security, it also protects the Reich from external threats such as espionage through the Sicherheitsdienst, the Reich’s main intelligence agency. With unlimited power, the blessing of the Führer, along with limited oversight, the Allgemeine-SS is a powerful organization, even powerful when underestimated by its adversaries."

 GER_Deutsche_Arbeitsfront: "Deutsche Arbeitsfront"
 GER_Deutsche_Arbeitsfront_desc: "There is a significant amount of independent trade unions throughout Germany, supposedly to enable collective bargaining and allow fair worker rights for their members. However, these are merely fronts as these trade unions are in fact recruitment grounds for Communist sympathizers, indoctrinating our labor force into subscribing to the morally degrading ideology that merely oppresses, not empower workers.\n\nTo alleviate this dilemma, we shall create the Deutsche Arbeitsfront or German Labor Front. This trade union will be a national trade union, with the state as the prime representative of the labor force. All members must renounce their membership in other trade unions, and are mandated to join. This will not only remove Communist influence in our workers but will ensure proper labor welfare to our people."

This has begun to take its toll on our workers, causing many to become less productive, and many workers are discriminated against because of their low wages due to the current class divide.\n\nTo combat the current state of our tourism sector, as well as to improve the well-being and equality of our workers, our brilliant Führer has begun to initiate the 'Kraft durch Freude' or 'Strength Through Joy' program. The Kraft durch Freude program, overseen by the Deutsche Arbeitsfront, aims to bring world-class tourism and leisure to the average German worker, improving their well-being and morale as well as motivating them to work harder for Germany and the Führer!\n\nThe KdF will organize a variety of events and activities, as well as subsidize many workers' vacations and cruise trips. The KdF will also work to improve workplace hygiene and air quality, which will significantly improve working conditions in many workplaces.\n\nIf successfully implemented, this program will, at last, improve our currently stagnant tourism, bring equality to the common worker, and greatly improve his well-being."

This process, however, is not widespread in Germany due to the high production costs and its, from a purely economic viewpoint, infeasibility.\n\nTo circumnavigate this we have decided to approach IG Farben, Germany's largest chemical company, with a deal, in which they produce synthetic oil exclusively for the German Army, in return for a guarantee 5% return investments and several other favors, like further rearmament deals and other government contracts."

As such, while we are more than eager to rearm ourselves and solidify ourselves as the dominant power in Europe, we simply can’t afford Allied sanctions. However, we have a lifeline. Our president of the Reichsbank, Hjalmar Schacht, has recently proposed a solution, we shall create a shell company, called the Metallurgical Research Corporation, and we will secretly pool funds from the Reich’s greatest conglomerates as a means to fund our war effort. That way, the Allies wouldn’t be able to intervene, as they only see business conducted."

This, however, will not be achieved without a conflict with the Western powers, which will require a significant number of our soldiers to end. To station the majority of our troops in the East without compromising the defensive capabilities of our Western flank, we will need to construct strong fortifications along our border with France, our closest enemy.\n\nIf constructed, this line of fortifications, the Westwall, will allow for us to station fewer troops at the border while still providing a significant obstacle for enemy armies wanting to pass through, delaying them significantly, and giving us time to send reinforcements if necessary."

Albert Speer, the new Minister for Armaments and War Production, knows how to rectify these problems. Stopping the production of countless pieces of equipment, standardizing most of what remains, and scrapping the obsolete designs can fix the problem, whilst also simultaneously cutting back on designs that would take years to develop and large amounts of resources to prototype, let alone manufacture. He also proposes standardizing large amounts of equipment used in manufacturing the Luftwaffe's planes, to ensure that a shortage of parts cannot occur unless the units are literally starved of equipment. These methods and tactics are sure to streamline military production, and to simplify our war economy as much as is feasibly possible."

Every day, our products spurt out from the arms factories, supplying millions of the Reich's good men. There is, however, the possibility that our cowardly enemies may choose to begin an aerial bombing campaign on us. This is a major risk as a depleted industry would mean a possible collapse of our frontlines. The Mittelwerk Project has been suggested by some of our top scientists and engineers to develop underground factories. Though it may sound slightly absurd, the construction of factories underground means we can have no reason to fear should we lose the air war.

The foremost example of this would be our Führer, Adolf Hitler, interfering with our military matters. The OKH and OKW have prided itself on its independence, yet now we find ourselves stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\nThe Reich's great leader has been taking more and more interest in countermanding our orders and introducing his own to be acted upon. Whilst it is true that the Führer's decisions have been helpful in the past, there is a large possibility that his demands may be too much to act upon.

Papa Freidrich goes down to the local bierhaus to talk with the other Weltkrieg veterans, as does Wilhelm. Almost nothing has changed, except for the fact that Wilhelm is missing his right arm, Freidrich's wife was killed in a bombing raid and Peter, Friedrich's pride and joy, won't be coming home.\n\nThe fact that so many of our Deutsche families are missing part of their family shows us the fact that it is imperative to keep up morale on the homefront.

To ensure our children have a stable future, we must adapt the concept of social autarky, by promoting Austerity and cutting about a quarter of welfare benefits.

By ensuring total control over the Reichsmark, investors translate it as a lack of confidence in the German economy, thereby giving them no reason to invest if the state is paranoid over vital monetary policies.

The Blutschutzgesetz ensures that anyone with even a slight of Jewish heritage is prohibited from mixing with pure Aryans. Even Mixed-Race Jews and Aryans could be a threat to the German Reich and therefore under these new laws will not be allowed Citizenship. Racial Infamy too has been heavily outlawed as we mustn’t allow our own German blood brethren to procreate with the Jews.

We need a stronger ally, one that’s not only powerful but reliable in its strength. Recently, our former adversaries, the Empire of Japan, has recently undergone its own nationalist revolution against the Western powers who take Japan’s strength for granted. We, however, do not, and in fact, we applaud their strength. So much so, that it is worth investing an alliance with them.

We need to fix this, and so mass mechanization of the infantry must be started. One of the methods towards achieving this has been Panzergrenadiers, which reportedly do well in transport and combat, yet struggle as they suffer from the same disease that plagues the Panzers: mechanical issues.

Whilst people may suggest that U-Boots are more effective in disrupting and destroying convoys, the pocket battleship is far more worthy of the title 'raider'.\n\nA Panzerschiff can trail a convoy for days, or weeks even, just like a U-Boot, however, U-Boots do not come armed with 11-inch cannons. Panzerschiffe can swoop in like a hawk into the middle of the convoy, guns blazing, destroy what they need, and get out. This approach is much more effective, as you can build 18 U-Boots for the price of a 'pocket battleship', and they can destroy as much tonnage as any wolf pack.

While the bombing capability of the aircraft is mediocre, its speed and ability in recon more than make up.

When she entered the meeting room, she immediately noticed the tense atmosphere and tension that loomed in the room, even though both von Papen and Hitler immediately dropped their conversation to await their beverages, looking at her with impatience, waiting to resume their verbal battle. She quickly set down the tray and almost sprinted out of the room, eager to escape this nightmare of a meeting and again began to await orders in the servants' kitchen.\n\nAfter almost two hours of nothing, curiosity and a hint of boredom overcame her and she pressed her ear to the door in order to learn something about this curious meeting and while she only heard a fraction of the conversation regarding minister positions, the head of government and Hindenburg amongst other things, she only began realizing what was just discussed, when the terms \"joint government\" and \"Reichskanzler Hitler\", were uttered followed by the sound of what appeared to be a handshake."

 GER_Reichskanzler_Hitler.2.d: "Berlin, the city that never sleeps, literally. Over the past few days, the city of Berlin has been rife with political instability and the deterioration of social order. It is common to see a random citizen being beaten and bruised based on assumptions of either being a Communist or a Fascist. Law and Order? Those are things of the past here in this city.\n\nYet, it is eerily quiet.\n\nIn Berlin-Dahlem, it is devoid of chaos, rather it is the only enclave of tranquility. Thanks to Joachim von Ribbentrop, one of Hitler's inner circle, it has remained such silence compared to the rest of Berlin. That is until convoys of cars started roaming its roads. The automobile is not uncommon in Germany, but these are not ordinary cars. These are luxury cars, cars that are mostly owned by the highest echelons of German society. What is happening?\n\nThen, one by one, they got out of their cars. Hitler, Göring, von Papen, von Hindenburg - all of them arrived at Ribbentrop's residence. However, it is not just any von Hindenburg, it is Oskar von Hindenburg - son of Reichspräsident Hindenburg. They entered Ribbentrop's residence, exchanging greetings then ceased such and started business. Hitler asked Oskar into a private room in the villa, out of sight of von Papen or Ribbentrop. No one could hear what was going on the room - the four walls were insulated in soundproofing. All that was heard were merely loud noises, some in jest and some in annoyance.\n\nOskar exited the room, seemingly shocked yet with vigour in his face. Von Papen went to Hitler, \"Herr Hitler, what happened?\" Hitler replied with glee, \"A revolution happened, Herr Papen. The old man will be under our grasp.\" As soon as Hitler uttered such words, von Papen knew Hitler was the right man for the job. Von Papen has pledged his loyalty to Hitler, and plans are now in motion."

It wasn't the first time he has been forced to wait in his political career but it was the first time someone has done this to send a message to him. \"Don't try again, you lost.\" But despite the countless hours of discussion, the argument against the seemingly impossibly stubborn mind of the old General, he hadn't given up on his proposal. He had to try once more to convince him.\n\nSchleicher entered his office. Slumped into his chair with baggy eyes, a shaking hand and an ashtray that overflowed, it seemed that the wise old man with the determined eyes and sure voice he knew before had aged 20 years in just a year. Schleicher pitied him, but he had no choice but to deny the old man his rest. \"Reichspräsident, I hope that the time you had to ponder convinced you that my proposal is the only way to prevent Germany from destroying itself. An intelligent man like you truly must understand the need for these, I admit, rather dramatic measures.\" Hindenburg's brow furrowed. \"No. Schleicher, you can't just declare a state of emergency and hope that the Nazis and Communists just... accept it.\" Schleicher responded immediately with anger. \"So what else should we do? Do nothing and twiddle our thumbs, waiting, until all this - the economic crisis, the Nazis, the communists just - disappear!? You can't be serious... What do you want to do?\"\n\nA moment of silence filled the room. The tired eyes of the old man betrayed his intentions. Schleicher resumed his shouting match immediately. \"You can't be serious! You really think listening to von Papen will do you any good? What has gotten into you?\" \"Enough of this!\" The old man nearly jumped from his seat and just for a moment it seemed his spirit had returned, but then he fell back into his chair - drained of life once more. \"I won't approve your proposal, Herr von Schleicher. It would be this Republic's undoing. Now get out.\""

He has justified this by saying that 'it is the only way to save the Republic from the forces that wish to end it.'\n\nThe Reichskanzler has never been outwardly against the idea of emergency powers coming into play, as repeated meetings have shown - however, it had been doubted that he would ever attempt to force this through. However, the threat of Zentrum being voted out of their seats and the coalition falling apart in the coming elections may have forced his hand into play, and the consequences have been dire.\n\nThe SPD, KPD, and liberal parties have all spoken out in disgust against the motion set forth by Schleicher. Making up a majority in the Reichstag, these parties would have been able to put down the vote if it happened. Schleicher immediately withdrew his proposal, drawing the ire of the DNVP and NSDAP as a 'spineless coward' not willing to do what must be done.

His coercing of Hindenburg into acting on emergency decrees alone has put the already fragile state of democracy in the Republic into a crisis for the last four years, with government after government unable to create a true majority coalition.\n\nA few days ago, von Schleicher requested the dissolution of the current Reichstag government - which the Reichspräsident von Hindenburg denied emphatically, citing the instability that would be caused if such an action was undertaken. With a no-confidence vote in Schleicher's government bound to be successful on the reconvening of the Reichstag and his reputation as the 'destroyer of governments' finally coming back to haunt him, von Schleicher has resigned his position as Reichskanzler effective immediately.\n\nNo one knows what the future will bring now, but Germany looks upon the sunrise with hope in its heart."

The regional parliaments of Germany have always been a limit to the power of the leader of the Weimar Republic and the Reichstag, and they remain a limit to us now.\n\nTo amend this state of affairs and right the wrongs created by the Weimar bureaucracy, the Gleichschaltung has been created - alternatively referred to as the 'Law Concerning the Reconstruction of the Reich' which will dissolve all regional parliaments down to communal level. A new centralized system will be implemented in which the bloated mess of the Free States, Free Cities, and Prussia are replaced by the thirty Reichsgaue - each of which is led by a Gauleiter, directly appointed by the German government.\n\nThese new Reichsgaue will become the administrative cornerstone of the Reich and the tool with which we can do away with the cumbersome Weimar federal system once and for all - allowing our government to use its power to focus on the real issues faced by the Reich."

And while this law has greatly helped the recovery of the Reich from the sectionalism of the Weimar Republic, it is still a necessity to remove the last traces of its incompetent administration, one of the most notable nonsense being the fact that their people from, for example, Prussia or Baden still have citizenship of these former states, in addition to their German citizenships. Due to the fact that this is a direct affront to the Volksgemeinschaft and the Unity of all Germans, we will immediately get rid of these arbitrary divisions. In addition to this, we will also appoint a Reichsstatthalter (Reich Governor) to each State in order to further increase the Central government's power over Germany.

A new decree, named the Law Against the Founding of New Parties, is a comprehensive piece of legislation, outlawing any new political party or organization after its passage into law, and deems only the NSDAP as the legal political party of the Reich, with other German political parties being absorbed into it, or its members being prosecuted depending on their political affiliation.

Announced by Reichskanzler Adolf Hitler via radio address, the concordat has laid out the conditions upon which the rights of Catholics within German borders will be protected - many of which are quite advantageous to Germany.\n\nThe world has looked upon the new Reich government and its extreme views with distaste, with many international experts claiming it may take many months for the first major nations to come forth in open support of them. To all academics and experts' surprise, the first to open their arms to the new German government was the Holy See, headed by Pope Pius XII.\n\nThe conditions of the treaty effectively remove Catholic influence from German politics entirely in return for a guarantee of protection from persecution. Stuck to or not, this agreement is a major diplomatic victory for the German Reich's new government. The act of tolerance towards Catholics does indeed show signs of moderation in Hitler's approach as predicted by many experts, the pragmatism of his new position of power perhaps causing him to revise some of his more extreme outlying policies."

To their surprise, the first people to open their arms to the new government in Berlin in an attempt to create lasting peace was the Holy See itself - headed by Pope Pius XII. The honorable Reichskanzler has persisted in making sure that the rights of Catholics within German territory are maintained while preventing Catholic intervention in politics as a whole.\n\nThe Church has insisted that the Concordat is not an endorsement of National Socialist teachings, the Reichskanzler cared little.

Ostensibly carried out in retribution for the assassination of Nazi diplomat Ernst Eduard vom Rath at the hands of exiled Polish Jew Herschel Grynszpan in Paris, this night of terror and violence has resulted in the deaths of nearly a hundred Jews across Germany.\n\nThe name Kristallnacht, or 'Night of the Broken Glass', refers to the countless shards of broken glass glittering on the streets after the looting, where crowds of bystanders stood in passive observation. Fire departments, rather than attempting to save the buildings set alight, instead opted to prevent the fires from spreading and allowed hundreds of homes and synagogues to burn. In contrast, many Germans have opted to help their Jewish neighbors rebuild their homes and businesses.\n\nFor many in the German Jewish community, the wounds of Kristallnacht, both physical and psychological, may never fully heal."

Today, these hopes have shattered with the windows of thousands of Jewish owned homes and businesses. Overnight, Nazi paramilitaries and their allies torched synagogues, smashed store windows, and wreaked havoc on Jewish communities all over Germany in a pogrom that left almost a hundred dead.\n\nThe Night of the Broken Glass, or 'Kristallnacht' in German, has drawn fury from the international community and washed away any support the Hitler regime has among the British and American public. As the London Times noted, \nNo foreign propagandist bent upon blackening Germany before the world could outdo the tale of burnings and beatings, of blackguardly assaults on defenseless and innocent people, which disgraced that country yesterday.\n"

I was the youngest, and this was my first outing. In front of me strode Rudolf, the leader. He was tall and strong. His backpack was heavy and pressed down on his shoulders. Rudolf carried the bread for us six boys, the cooking pot, and a pile of books, from which he would read us wonderfully thrilling stories at night in the hostel. My backpack only contained a shirt, a couple of sneakers, washing utensils, and some cooking gear, apart from a tarpaulin for rainy days and straw beds - yet I thought I could not lug this backpack any longer.\n\nMy comrades all were somewhat older and had camping experience. They hardly felt the heat and hardship of the march. Every now and then they would sigh and drink lukewarm coffee from their canteens. More and more I remained behind, even though I tried to make up for my slack by running. Suddenly, Rudolf turned around. He stopped and watched me crawling up to him from a distance, while our comrades continued in the direction of a few trees on the horizon. “Tired?” Rudolf asked me, kindly. Ashamed, I had to say yes.\n\nSlowly, we walked side by side. I was limping, but I did not want to let this on to Rudolf. When we got to a juniper bush, the leader sat down and said: “For a little rest!” Relieved, I threw myself down. I did not want to talk, for I was far too shy. Rudolf gave me something to drink. I thanked him and leaned back, glad to be able to stretch my aching feet, and before I knew it I was sleeping.

Schleicher has criticized our administration’s ineffective attempts to mediate the conflict and how the SA now appears to be operating independently from the very party that created it. Furthermore, he warns that, if something is not done soon, tensions will reach to a critical point and one side will raise their arms against the other, threatening the stability of the already fragile nation. Not long after these criticisms reached the ears of our Führer, some within our government have proposed a cabinet reorganization, one that would be more capable of dealing with the current crisis. The changes proposed include Schleicher himself occupying the position of Vice-Chancellor, Röhm being appointed the Minister of Defence, Heinrich Brüning as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Gregor Strasser being Minister of National Economy.

Of course, silence was always meant to be broken, as Franz von Papen, the Vice-Chancellor of the German Reich, has shown no restraints in expressing his profound opposition to the Sturmabteilung and Ernst Röhm, calling them instigators to a “Second Revolution” that will supposedly correct the failures of our Führer’s policies of recreating Germany into a powerful state. However, Papen deviated from his speech, spewing out anti-government propaganda and the reinstatement of civil liberties, eventually bringing it to censorship by Joseph Goebbels. Nevertheless, von Papen’s speech is a warning call to Berlin’s influential elite and the Führer himself.

Previously Röhm had expressed discontent with how Hitler had allied with conservative forces in the government and corporate powers and accused him of betraying the National Socialist cause, and Schleicher had expressed nothing but contempt for Hitler upon his appointment to the Chancellery making for strange bedfellows but agreeing that Hitler was a corrupting influence on Germany and its people.

 # German-Polish NAP Event Chain
 GER_POL_NAP.1.t: "A non aggression pact with the Germans?"
 GER_POL_NAP.1.d: "Today the German ambassador Hans-Adolf von Moltke presented several documents outlining a non-aggression pact between the German Reich and the Polish Republic to Marshal Józef Piłsudski. The non-aggression pact would guarantee that both countries will only resolve to bilateral negotiations, while both sides will abstain from any military actions against one another for the next ten years. Furthermore, if we sign the pact Germany will declare itself willing to recognize the new Polish borders, established in 1919 after the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, while also confirming Danzig's status as a free city. Piłsudski seems to be in favor of the agreement due to the expected French defensive war doctrine and the possibility of gaining a partner against the Soviet Union. However, there are still voices inside the government that advises against the pact, since it would most likely anger France, damaging the relations with our close military and trade partner."

The pact also guarantees to Poland that we will accept the new eastern border, established by the Novemberverräter in 1919, while also confirming Danzig's status as a free city.

Each time, the notion was refused - and it seemed that the meeting would reach a boiling point. That it did - with the German delegation announcing the exit of the German nation from the League of Nations, citing protest over other nations' constant maintaining of the humiliating treaties inflicted upon the German nation following the Great War that still continues to this day while being unwilling to follow their own peacekeeping principles.\n\nIn line with the temperate tone of all the German pronouncements, officials made it plain to the press that they planned to leave the league smoothly and in a friendly manner, as righteous protestors and not as rebels.

 GER_LoN.2.t: "Germany Repudiates the Locarno Treaty"
 GER_LoN.2.d1: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]It is clear the time of German cooperation with the West is over. Signed in 1925, and one of the major achievements of the Weimar government under the progressive reforms of Gustav Stresemann, the Treaty of Locarno represented the beginning of an internationalist mindset within Germany. Though the scars of the Great war were still deep, the Treaty paved the way for reconciliation between France and Germany as well as a part of the greater struggle for global peace. No longer would the Germans claim French land, and in return, they were allowed membership into the League of Nations. With the rise of Hitler and the Third Reich, as well as the worrying rearmament taking place under the Nazis, the future of the relationships between the West and the Germans is uncertain. Claiming it was in justified response to the Franco-Soviet Alliance, the Germans have recently re-entered the demilitarized Rhineland with their soldiers. Although the moral validity of this action is questionable at the least, no response was deemed necessary, further than condemnation. Hitler has taken this as an opportunity for a full repudiation of the Locarno Treaties, an obvious sign of his war-mongering ambitions in the West. With this destruction of the Treaty, he has reasserted his claims on many Western territories, including those in Alsace-Lorraine and Eupen-Malmedy."
 GER_LoN.2.d2: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The 1925 Treaty of Locarno stands as an obvious nuisance in the German plans for asserting her European dominance. Agreed upon under in the influence of Gustav Stresemann in the time of the dysfunctional Weimar government, the treaties assured that Germany accepted the Western territorial concessions. The signing of the treaties placated the French, as they now considered the threat of German invasion to be neutralized. But now the time of the Weimar Republic is over, as the New Third Reich is stamping their mark on the history of central Europe. The Franco-Soviet alliance of 1935 is a clear violation of the Locarno Treaty, no longer shall Germany stand idle whilst the Western powers rest on the laurels of Versailles. The justified response of the Germans, through the remilitarization of the Rhineland, was met with no opposition, other than meaningless condemnation. This display of spinelessness by the British and the French paves the way for further development on Hitler’s ambitions in the West, as the Reich reasserts its Western claims on previously German lands, such as those in Alsace-Lorraine and Eupen-Malmedy. It seems a Western war is imminent…"
 GER_LoN.2.d3: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The Locarno Treaties were put in place in 1925, under the influence of Gustav Stresemann, to ensure that the new Weimar Government would not lay claim to any previously German territories, conceded to the allies in the Treaty of Versailles. Although the signing of the treaty was representative of a new, internationalist mindset developing in the major powers of Europe, the idealistic dreams of world peace seem to be collapsing. With the ascension of the National Socialists, Germany seems to be increasingly restless and the prospect of another European centered conflict, on a similar scale to the last, is becoming ever more realistic. The case of an increasingly aggressive Germany seems to be worrying the French and the British and precautions have already begun to be taken. The Franco-Soviet Alliance was signed in 1935 in order to deter Hitler from expanding too far, either East or West, at the risk of a war on two fronts, a factor playing a major part in the downfall of the German Empire in the First War. The German’s responded opportunistically to this shortly afterward, taking advantage of the Western power’s preoccupation in the Abyssinian crisis through the reoccupation of the Rhineland, demilitarised since the Treaty of Versailles. Now the Nazis have taken their Western ambitions a step further in a total repudiation of the Locarno Treaties as well as reasserting their claims over German influenced Western territories, such as those in Alsace-Lorraine and Eupen-Malmedy. Goodness knows what lies ahead in the Future of Europe."

Nevertheless, they mounted on the final attack, one last hopeless attempt to subvert the coming catastrophe or at least keep their hands clean.\n“With all due respect, I can only repeat myself, marching into the Rhineland in our current position is almost hopeless. Our military is weak and the French know this. They would just move in and occupy the Rhineland again, this time for good. No treaties, diplomatic negotiations, or demilitarization. Just occupation and perhaps even annexation. It is just a risk we can't take. We must either wait and build up our forces even more or we could always try to negotiate a remilitarization.“\n“I agree. We should at least try to negotiate, before provoking the French in such a bold-“\n“Meine Herren, I appreciate your concern, but we all know that the French won't even try to reach an agreement with us. The future belongs to those who seize it and I have no intention of sitting in Berlin, doing nothing, while the world overtakes us.

Currently, the French government has been making overtures to the Judeo-Bolshevik tyrants of the Soviet Union as evident by the Franco-Soviet pact of 1935.\n\nThis is clearly an effort to prepare for an invasion of the Fatherland that will result in its ultimate destruction if not stopped.

Hitler has offered to rejoin the League of Nations and sign a non-aggression pact with us on the condition that we accept the remilitarization.\nBut why should we take the word of a man who has already broken it? Though they couldn’t have picked a worse time for us, especially with recent instability, the unpopularity of mobilizing the army, our economic downturn and elections soon, we couldn’t afford even the lightest intervention especially if the troop estimates of General Gamelin are correct. The fact that the Franc has been radically devalued as of late, means we couldn’t afford a single day of mobilization much less an entire war as it is looking like it might shape up to be if we were to actually intervene and even then we would still feel the aftershocks of our mobilization if they backed down."

Notable Events:\nOur airborne forces, deployed from Ju 52 transport aircraft and supported by Luftwaffe fighters and bombers, entered combat with defending enemy forces immediately after landing and took heavy casualties during the first day of fighting. No defending airplanes attempted to intercept, but enemy AA guns destroyed several aircraft.\n\nDespite these difficulties, our troops were able to sabotage enemy communication lines, take the first airfield, and defeat a hastily assembled enemy counterattack. After the capture of the first enemy airstrip, our newly reinforced troops were able to take the remaining two airfields as the enemy withdrew from the island.\n\nIII. Final Conclusions:\nThe primary strength of the paratrooper is the element of surprise, but this is maintained only for a short period.

So, supported by Panzers and thunderous artillery barrages, our infantry units rapidly moved into the Polish hinterland with relative ease.\n\nFrom the very initial stages, the inability of the Polish army was evident, which desperately sent out suicidal cavalry charges to face our mighty steel beasts, resulting in very easy victories.

Final Conclusions:\nWith us securing Denmark, the way to Oslo has been opened up. While the Danish campaign was almost bloodless, our generals have urged caution for our next target - Norway. It is much larger, and possesses much more inhospitable terrain and an extreme climate. In order to maintain the element of surprise, the OKH has urged the OKW to begin the next phase of Unternehmen Weserübung at the earliest opportunity."

 GER_Unternehmen_Success.5.t: "Unternehmen Aida is a Success"
 GER_Unternehmen_Success.5.d: "I. Operational Overview:\nAfter a long struggle through the Western Desert, culminating in fierce battle around El Alamein, the Afrika Korps, with Italian assistance have finally broken through. Capturing Cairo, the Nile Delta and advancing to the Suez Canal, Unternehmen Aïda has been brought to a victorious end.\n\nII. Events\nDespite logistical constraints in the North Africa, German forces conducting Operation Sonnenblume changed the tide of war in the campaign, bringing the British to El Alamein, where ferocious combat nearly brought the advance to an end. However, decisive Italian action under General Bastico stalled the British long enough for Panzer forces to breakthrough.\n\nThe actions at El Alamein routed the British Army, and sent them in a fighting retreat through Egypt proper. After the capture of port facilities at Alexandria, Axis forces drove on Cairo, with jubilant Italian and German troops holding victory celebrations at the ancient pyramids of Giza.\n\nIII. Final Conclusions:\nThe effective fall of Egypt in large part ends the North African campaign, and paves the way for Axis forces to move on the Levant, and more importantly, the Suez, which could cut Allied shipping into the Indian Ocean. For what it's worth though, this serves as a major Axis victory."

 GER_Unternehmen_Success.6.t: "Fall Achse is a Success"
 GER_Unternehmen_Success.6.d: "I. Operational Overview:\nThe conquest of Italy, Fall Achse, has succeeded after a drawn out struggle between ill-prepared but ferociously fierce Italian troops and the invading German armies. Emulating the great Germanic invasion of Rome many hundreds of years ago, the once proud eagle of the Mediterranean lays under the Aryan boot.\n\nII. Notable Events:\nThe Apennine Peninsula is a great strategic position, defended by the Alps to the north and the vastness of the Mediterranean to the south. Yet still, the mighty Wehrmacht punctured this barrier. After gaining aerial superiority, large numbers of Fallschirmjägers were deployed to key sites in Tyrol and Friuli, seizing supply depots and rail links. Holding out against Italian counteracts, this move precipitated the arrival of German reinforcements through the Alpine passes, bringing the battle into the Po Valley. The Führer then expressed a desire to wage psychological warfare, ordering massive bombing raids against major cities. After battles through the Apennine Mountains to the South, Mussolini declared surrender, under great pressure from his people to avoid decimation.\n\nIII. Final Conclusions:\nThe conquest of Italy leaves Germany and Europe at large in a precarious situation. Now, the Reich holds effective domain over all of Central Europe, from the harsh winds of the Baltic to the soothing breeze of Sicily. Such a move puts every neighbour on edge, while also setting the ideological precedent that National Socialism and Fascism are not allies. This now also opens an avenue for German operations in the Mediterranean and Africa."

 GER_Unternehmen_Success.7.t: "Fall Otto is a Success"
 GER_Unternehmen_Success.7.d: "I. Operational Overview:\nThe invasion and occupation of Austria, codenamed Fall Otto, has concluded with few troubles. What minimal resistance the Austrian Bundesheer had put up has been swept aside with relative ease, bringing the campaign to an end with a pompous parade through the historic boulevards and walkways of Vienna.\n\nII. Notable Events:\nAustria, while holding little territory to its name, is extremely mountainous, most of it laying in the gargantuan peaks of the Alps. The north is wide open though, with cities such as Salzburg, Linz and Vienna resting along the Danubian banks. A fast sweep through the north was authorized, as well as smaller Gebirgsjäger detachments moving into Alpine valleys. The mobilization of the Bundesheer was generally uncoordinated, leading to many reservist formations being run over while they were arming. Significant fighting in Linz was reported, though surrender was issued after Vienna fell.\n\nIII. Final Conclusions:\nIntegrating the Österreich presents many more opportunities for influence in Southern Europe. Perhaps more importantly, the door to the Balkans now lay wide open. From Zagreb in the north to Athens in the south, the Wehrmacht is now positioned to exercise it's motorized muscle, should Berlin conclude it necessary. Whatever the future holds, the Germans are united together again, but this time, by bootheel."

 GER_Unternehmen_Success.8.t: "Unternehmen Weserübung Nord is a Success"
 GER_Unternehmen_Success.8.d: "I. Operational Overview:\nIn continuation of the first phase, the second phase of Unternehmen Weserübung was successfully launched and completed. With the utilisation of Denmark as a launching pad for the operation, the Wehrmacht successfully pre-empted any Allied moves and has occupied the Scandinavian nation of Norway.\n\nII. Notable Events:\nBuilding upon our successes in Unternehmen Weserübung Süd, the OKW assembled a special task force comprising of landing divisions, supported by the necessary aviation and naval elements from the Luftwaffe and the Kriegsmarine for the campaign in Norway. The invasion was necessitated by the threat to our iron shipments from Sweden, as intercepted allied radio traffic had hinted at Allied intentions of occupying Norway to cut us off from the precious iron ore coming from Sweden.\n\nWorking in close collaboration with the Luftwaffe and the Kriegsmarine, the Heer Divisions made the necessary landings along the Norwegian coastline, and often, Fallschirmjäger detachments would precede the landings. Although the largest part of the Norwegian government was able to escape, the entire nation and its populace has been brought under complete German rule.\n\nIII. Final Conclusions:\nWith the wrapping up of Unternehmen Weserübung, the trade route to Sweden has been secured, which will prove invaluable in fueling the wartime industry. As of the date of the writing of this operation report, the forces in Norway are beginning to prepare the nation for a long term occupation."

 GER_Unternehmen_Success.9.t: "Fall Rot is a Success"
 GER_Unternehmen_Success.9.d: "I. Operational Overview:\nThe entirety of Fall Rot's outlined objectives have been met with overwhelming success. Merry toasts were raised at the OKW Headquarters in Wünsdorf as soon as the communique informing them about the surrender of the last of the French unit was passed on.\n\nII. Notable Events:\nWith the French having established extremely strong fortified positions along the front line, they repelled numerous attacks, posing a situation that was of serious concern to our military commanders. What followed was described as very intense artillery and air bombardment at the selected points of their defense, the Schwerpunkts. Soon after, several of our divisions experienced rapid breakthroughs.\n\nExploiting these initial breakthroughs, the infantry soon rushed through these gaps and rapidly fanned out, maintaining continuous maneuvers in order to rapidly disorient and prevent the French from forming a new line of defense. In no time, the bulk of our armies had pushed the French deep into their country, with our forces occupying Paris in quick succession after it had been declared an open city by the retreating French soldiers.\n\nIII. Final Conclusions:\nThe goals of Fall Rot have been achieved, and triumphant Germans march in the Champs-Élysées, past the Arc de Triomphe. With the victory over the French, the Heer has irrefutably established the dominance of the German Nation over the French, which will now pay in kind to the humiliation they inflicted upon our people with the abominable Treaty of Versailles."

 GER_Unternehmen_Success.10.t: "Unternehmen Seelöwe is a Success"
 GER_Unternehmen_Success.10.d: "I. Overview\nUnternehmen Seelöwe, the invasion of Great Britain, is finally over. The operation involved the largest seaborne invasion in history and led to subsequent land combat operations throughout Great Britain. Carried out in accordance with Führer Directive No. 16, we have achieved a great victory.\n\nII. Notable Events:\nAs stated earlier, the operation involved the assembly of the largest concentration of combined land, naval and aerial military assets under a singular field command structure. Preceding the operation was an intense sea and air-based campaign to minimise the threat posed by the Royal Air Force, and the Royal Navy to the invasion force and their necessary supply lanes. Due to the critical nature of the campaign, the Führer's headquarters were in constant contact with the OKW during the planning and execution of the operation, with the directives from the OKW being consistently changed at the Führer's insistence.\n\nThe invasion fleet, and escorted by the bulk of the Kriegsmarine to ward off any RN forays, was assisted from the air by Albert Kesselring's Luftflotte 2 and Hugo Sperrle's Luftflotte 3. Despite intense fire from the coastal batteries, our troops managed to secure a beachhead. Along with the use of overwhelming and concentrated air power, our Panzers were able to smash through the British lines and spread out into the interior of the Isle, using classic tactics of 'Bewegungskrieg'. It didn't take long for London to fall, and the rest of the major population centres with it.\n\nIII. Final Conclusions:\nThe success of Unternehmen Seelöwe has established complete German dominance over Western Europe. Copies of the \"Sonderfahndungsliste Grossbritannien\" and the \"Informationsheft Grossbritannien\" have been distributed among the officers of the occupation forces, and accordingly, the corresponding roundups in association with Schutzstaffel personnel have begun."

 GER_Unternehmen_Success.11.t: "Unternehmen Herkules is a Success"
 GER_Unternehmen_Success.11.d: "I. Operational Overview:\nUnternehmen Herkules, the Wehrmacht operation in conjunction with their Italian counterparts in Forze Armate Italiane has been successful. The island of Malta has been occupied, and the supply lanes in the Mediterranean secured for our usage.\n\nII. Notable Events:\nA joint operation, Unternehmen Herkules involved forces from the different branches of the Wehrmacht and the Forze Armate Italiane. The OB Süd allocated significant resources for this campaign, even siphoning off from other regions in the Mediterranean Theatre. The operation was planned in constant correspondence with the Italian commanders in the region.\n\nAfter the green light had been given, the Luftwaffe and the Regia Marina escorted the invasion fleet and warded off aerial and naval attacks by the British. Simultaneously the Fallschirmjäger and elements of the Paracadutisti Folgore conducted airdrops to secure bridgeheads on the island. Despite the fierce resistance and heavy anti-air barrage, the paratroopers were able to hold on until reinforcements from the main invasion force arrived. After some consolidation, the established forces conducted a general offensive to defeat the British and soon had secured the surrender of the tattered remnants of the garrison.\n\nIII. Final Conclusions:\nThe success of Unternehmen Herkules has decisively shifted the balance in our favour regarding the Mediterranean Theatre. The occupation of Malta will grant us almost complete control of the Mediterranean shipping lanes, affording us unrestricted freedom of movement in the region, as well as opportunities to constantly harass British naval traffic in the area."

 GER_Unternehmen_Success.12.d: "I. Operational Overview:\nThe invasion and occupation of Turkey, codenamed Unternehmen Gertrud, has finally been fought to a successful conclusion after lasting combat throughout the Anatolian Peninsula. The Swastika now proudly flies over old Istanbul, and the Hagia Sophia is patrolled by German boots.\n\nII. Notable Events:\nWhen planning the operation, staffers had concerns regarding the elevated and barren landscape of Anatolia, which would almost surely give way to harsh attrition. These concerns proved well in order over the course of the campaign, as organized Turkish resistance caused immense German casualties. Nonetheless, continued armoured drives from Kars to Ankara, supported by huge detachments of Gebirgsjägers, eventually whittled down Turkish formations to the point of mass desertion, surrender or devolution into unorganized partisan resistance. A joint Bulgarian-German assault on Istanbul reached the hallowed city’s outskirts, though under concerns of devastating urban combat, the ancient metropolis was placed under a continued bombardment and blockade until it was surrendered.\n\nIII. Final Conclusions:\nThe capitulation of Turkey precipitates further Axis operations into the Middle East, while also securing dominance over the Black Sea and granting access to port facilities in the Eastern Mediterranean. Control of the diverse and conflicted nation will be difficult, though could be achieved with a combination of collaboration and efficient brutality."

Operational Overview:\nUnternehmen Felix, conducted in close cooperation with the Fuerzas Armadas de España, has been a resounding success and has gained us complete control of the remote, yet strategically important Gibraltar, making us the gatekeepers of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nII. Notable Events:\nThe planning of the operation was done in close concert between the Wehrmacht and their Spanish counterparts in the Fuerzas Armadas de España, with the Spanish playing an important and decisive role in allowing the German units to successfully achieve their outlined objectives. While the Caudillo of Spain - Francisco Franco had initially shown hesitation in Spanish involvement in the operation, the standing Spanish membership of the Tripartite pact made him obligated to assist us.\n\nThe operation involved the crossing of the Pyrenees by the German forces and a straight lightning dash towards Gibraltar. With Spanish assistance, the speed of advance was considerably increased, but after reaching the \"Rock\", our forces had to face the extensive fortifications constructed by the British. However, our extensive planning and prior reconnaissance allowed for effective and accurate artillery bombardments and airstrikes by Luftwaffe units based in southern Iberia. Soon thereafter, Gibraltar had been brought under complete German control.\n\nIII. Conclusion:\nControl over Gibraltar has further whittled down British power projection, especially in the Mediterranean, and the success of Unternehmen Felix has further reaffirmed joint Spanish-German operational synergy."

Operational Overview:\nUnternehmen Felix, conducted in close cooperation between the various branches of the Wehrmacht, has been a resounding success and has gained us control of the remote yet strategically important Gibraltar, making us the gatekeepers of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nII. Notable Events:\nThe majority of planning of the operation was done by the OKW, with extensive aerial reconnaissance by the Luftwaffe and the U-boats of the Kriegsmarine. The largest contributing factor in opting for a naval assault was due to the waning strength of the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean theatre of operations. Another issue influencing the decision was the steadfast refusal by the Spanish Government to cooperate, as they vehemently rejected any involvement in our plans.\n\nThe operation involved the movement of the invasion fleet from [REDACTED], through the Mediterranean, along with the necessary naval and aerial support. The assault was hampered by the extreme distances involved in the operation from the launching point, but nonetheless, the forces had been able to push through the British defenses and secure the \"Rock\".\n\nIII. Conclusion:\nControl over Gibraltar has further whittled down British power projection, especially in the Mediterranean, and the success has further reaffirmed joint operational synergy between the different arms of the Wehrmacht."

 GER_Unternehmen_Success.15.d: "I. Operational Overview:\nDirective 21, issued from the authority of the Führer's Headquarters, called for the Wehrmacht to prepare an attack on Soviet Russia, designated Unternehmen Barbarossa. It outlined the overall operational goals and considerations for this colossal campaign in the east.\n\nII. Notable Events:\nExtensive intelligence-gathering efforts, planning, and studies had been conducted in the lead up to Unternehmen Barbarossa, to analyse and gauge Soviet strengths and weaknesses. The Bolsheviks, whose main military doctrine was of the offense, had stationed the majority of their active armies near the border. In order to destroy the Red Army in only a few months, German mobile troops would need to cut off the retreat of these forward formations, and dispatch them quickly.\n\nWith the beginning of the invasion was the assembly of the largest invasion force in the history of warfare. Upon receiving the codeword \"Düsseldorf\", our Eastern Armies were readied for action, and on the next day, began a massive artillery barrage along the frontline. Luftwaffe bombers conducted massive ground attacks and utterly destroyed the Red Air Force on the ground. Our Panzers began rapid and deep exploitations to encircle the Soviet forward armies. With overwhelming air superiority, our mobile troops continued their lightning-fast advances, encircling army after army until the Soviets simply ran out of men. Then in general offensive operations, the Heer pushed into and completely occupied the vast majority of the Western Soviet Union, with the Russian Bear having been finally defeated by the mighty German Eagle.\n\nIII. Final Conclusions:\nThe occupation and control over these newfound territories have granted the German people much needed Lebensraum in the East as per the \"Drag Nach Osten\". The swift victory in the East has granted the Reich access to immense natural resources, especially the oil in the Caucasus. These all will help the Reich in its long struggle to establish the \"Neue Ordnung\" in the world."

 GER_Unternehmen_Success.16.d: "I. Operational Overview:\nFall Grün, the military operation to wrest control of Czechoslovakia, has concluded in our favour after several decisive battles through the Czechoslovakian hinterlands. The scale of the war was great in comparison to the relative peace in Europe for the past 20 years, drawing back memories to the horror of the Great War and further complicating the political situation that exists today.\n\nII. Notable Events:\nThe war, being ideological and total in its nature, featured the use of mass terror bombing under orders from the Führer, seeking to pulverize the Czech war machine, and most importantly, their will to fight on. The Wehrmacht was also able to prove in some adaptations its theory of Schwerpunkt, striking the weak points of the Czech fort lines with hard and fast armoured assaults, supported by infantry concentrations and heavy air support. Even the vaunted Beneš Line was shattered under the duress of this attack. Nonetheless, determined Czechoslovakian troops were able to inflict a level of casualties on the Germans not predicted, making their advance costly and even grueling at times. When German boots stomped through Prague, the little nation lay in tatters, its cities strewn with rubble and its people bled white from the Luftwaffe’s terror campaign.\n\nIII. Final Conclusions:\nThe fall of Czechoslovakia cements the Reich’s dominance over Central Europe. The seizure of valuable Czech industrial assets will also feed the German war machine the resources needed to continue its immense buildup. The absence of Prague in the affairs of the Balkans also leaves a great void where there was once an outlet of mediation. This provides the Reich an opportunity to capitalize on this, and draw in the divided nations to its sphere."

 GER_Unternehmen_Success.17.d: "I. Operational Overview:\nFall Orient, the military operation that sought to conquer the Levant, has been fought out to a successful conclusion. While staffers originally envisioned Fall Orient to be a far larger operation to sweep through the Middle East, it was decided that the Levantine area was enough, for now. Now, the swastika flies over famed and ancient cities such as Jerusalem, Damascus and Bethlehem.\n\nII. Notable Events:\nThe main swing of the invasion came in from the Sinai, where troops of the original Afrika Korps were deployed in conjunction with Italian units. Not expecting significant resistance, the plan called for a direct strike through Palestine to the Euphrates, with smaller detachments crossing the Dead Sea into Amman and Jordan. Enemy resistance was formed out of only the remnants of the British colonial armies, many of whom were captured and disarmed throughout the campaign. Our forces were surprised to find a great deal of support from the local Arabic population, who celebrated the tossing out of the British and French colonial authorities.\n\nIII. Final Conclusions:\nThe conquest of the Levant allows the Axis to wield near total dominion over the Mediterranean, with the remaining Allied holdouts pushed into the sea. Furthermore, it may serve as a staging ground for deeper operations into the Middle East and Arabia. Throughout its extensive history, the Levant has seen many armies come and go, and now the Wehrmacht is the newest addition to that long lineage."

This was the largest seaborne invasion in history, even surpassing Unternehmen Seelöwe, the invasion of Great Britain.\n\nII. Notable Events:\nWith the successful course of the events of the war & Europa deemed sufficiently safe, the OKW began carrying out its routine preliminary work - information gathering, studies, & planning. Secret Kriegsmarine expeditions had conducted reconnaissance of the American East Coast, with the legendary U-boat commander \"Silent\" Otto Kretschmer leading a dangerous mission to map out the landing sites. Detailed instruction manuals, pamphlets & special equipment were issued to the troops taking part in the operation. Even the Panzer crews were issued with the new \"Seefibel\" as to how to take care of their vehicles when at sea. The designated divisions then trained in Northern France, using mock-ups in order to prepare.\n\nWhen ready, the invasion fleet set sail from Brittany and was escorted by an equally large Kriegsmarine task force, comprising of every possible ship the combined Axis alliance could muster.\n\nThe Americans were caught with complete surprise, as many had assumed that French Resistance members would've already forewarned them. The ignorance of Americans was exemplified, when some civilians actually helped the troops by guiding them to important roads & railway junctions, believing them to be a part of a mock-up exercise, despite our officers' accented English. Soon the landing sites and the entirety of vital objectives were secured.\n\nIII. Final Conclusions:\nThe success of Unternehmen Büffel has set the stage for the downfall of the United States of America, in the words of the Führer \"The Last Bastion of Decadency\", with Luftwaffe preparing airfields & the Heer accumulating supplies for the future land operations into the American hinterland."

 GER_Unternehmen_Success.19.d: "I. Overview:\nOperation Knickerbocker, the seizure of the British colonial holdings and port facilities of Bermuda and Newfoundland, has been an astonishing success, despite the fierce resistance from the local Allied Garrison.\n\nII. Events:\nThe invasion force, with the Marine-Stoßtruppen acting as the pathfinders, escorted by a sizable Kriegsmarine task force, achieved the element of surprise on the understrength Allied garrison. The batteries of our ships, from destroyers up to battleships, pounded away at key targets on the islands. The landing on Bermuda was almost effortless after the intense bombardment, with the British commander, worried about the safety of the civilian population, quickly surrendering his command. On Newfoundland, however, things were tougher than expected, as American units, equipped with heavy weapons had arrived earlier in the month. Nevertheless, our troops, undaunted by the odds they faced, continued the attack and overwhelmed the rest of the island garrison relatively quickly.\n\nIII. Soldier's Experiences:\nThe soldiers displayed high levels of morale. Commanders, who were veterans of the British, French, and Eastern campaigns were especially pleased to see casualty rates lower than the norm for our conquests. Overall, the soldiers were content with the operation, and one should expect them to be ready for the planned assault on Nordamerika.\n\nIV. Notes for the Next Operation:\nThe naval operations in Bermuda & Newfoundland highlighted significant deficiencies in our landing craft, which didn't fare well in rough seas. The OKM has proposed overhaul kits for these crafts to adopt for rough seas. Other than this, the operations were a major success and provided us with an important launching base for the invasion of America."

Their commander ordered the men to assemble into their companies, and five minutes after they had landed, they split off and headed for their targets, in the last remaining British bastion in Europe: Belfast.\n\nEncountering a unit of the British Home Guard that were disposed of easily, the Brandenburgers then spread out through the city and converged on their targets. The operation and execution went off without a hitch, and at 8:00 in the morning, the naval port of Belfast, housing one of the few remaining British aircraft carriers, exploded, taking with it a large part of the British fleet docked in the port. The airfield, local army base, and government centres also went up in a cloud of ash and debris, creating heavy chaos in the city.\n\nThe Brandenburgers, once they had accomplished their mission, returned to the beach for a pickup. However, it was not meant to be, as before they made it they were driven back into the city by a Canadian regiment. From there, they retreated into what remained of the port, securing what they could, and gathering any weapons they could find. For the next five hours, the Brandenburgers put up fierce resistance, slowly withdrawing until they were surrounded in the harbour master’s office, with no chance of escape.\n\nThen the Kriegsmarine arrived. Soon Marine raiders had swarmed the harbour, and with the assistance of offshore bombardment, relieved the exhausted Brandenburgers.

It seems increasingly unlikely that Italy would aid us should we find ourselves on the brink of annexation. Diplomacy with the Nazis is now the only way we can secure our nation's prospect of a future.\n\nOur short journey to the Berghof - Hitler’s residence - in Bavaria, felt very tense. After greeting the Führer on the steps of his home, it was not long until he started to discuss matters concerning our politics. He spoke for a while about how our nation was broken because of betrayal. That Austria stands alone, as the Western countries will not come to our aid. That he, the Führer, an Austrian man himself, will be the one to fix all our problems. As he spoke, his tone seemed that of an exhausted and impatient politician. \n\nLunch came next, and while the food was enjoyable, the atmosphere was not. We sat opposite Hitler, flanked by three Wehrmacht generals, a clear demonstration of power. When the plates were taken away, Hitler presented a document that demanded much more than we were anticipating. Most prominent, lifting the ban on the Austrian Nazis and allowing them key positions in the government. If we did not sign the list, German forces would march into our nation. No compromise, no amendments.\n\nBacks against the wall, we have signed, but we cannot guarantee ratification of the agreement. At the end of our time in Bavaria, we were accompanied back to the border by Franz von Papen, the ambassador to Vienna.\n\nWe hope the so-called "Berchtesgaden Agreement" has secured our independence, but Hitler certainly has the upper hand, and how long we can keep the peace is unknown."

Continuing to dismiss the League of Nations as nothing more than ‘an institution for defending the interests of Versailles’, he reiterated the aspiration of his nation at her former colonies, lost after the Great War. \n\nTerritorial expansion seems to be of utmost importance for the most powerful man in Germany, stating that ‘The German Reich is no longer willing to tolerate the suppression of ten million Germans across its borders.’, the implication being plain to see.\n\nTo mitigate the reaction of the European great powers, Hitler has reminded the French and the British that, excluding the colonial possessions, the Third Reich has no territorial disputes with them. Poland, apparently placated by promises of border integrity, has been a neutral, if cautious, observer of the unfolding events.\n\nExpressing gratitude to the Austria chancellor for trying to find a way which is ‘in the interests of both countries’, the Führer’s message is clear: all Germans must be united with the fatherland, and foreign powers have no right to intervene."

 GER_Anschluss.4.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg has announced that a referendum is to take place on the matter of ‘Anschluss’. An obvious move by the pro-independence politician to secure his nation’s sovereignty, Schuschnigg, with the approval of the President and other political leaders, has decided that a plebiscite is to take place to show the international community the wishes of the Austrian people on the matter.\n\nSeveral issues have already arisen, the most controversial of them perhaps being the wording of the referendum, which asks  ‘Are you for a free, German, independent and social, Christian and united Austria, for peace and work, for the equality of all those who affirm themselves for the people and Fatherland?’, with only a ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ answer possible.\n\nAdding to the controversy is the issue of voting, with members of the chancellor’s party being allowed to vote at any age while any other Austrian below the age of 24 is excluded, most likely due to the fact that most NSDAP sympathisers are among the youth\nWith internal and external disapproval, mostly from Germany, mounting, will Schuschnigg manage to preserve his nation?"

 GER_Anschluss.5.t: "Hitler Issues an Ultimatum!"
 GER_Anschluss.5.d: "The message from the Reich is clear: Hand over all power to the Austrian Nazis based in our country or prepare to be forcefully integrated into Germany.\n\nOur announcement of a referendum on Austrian independence has apparently enraged Hitler. Furthermore, he has also demanded we resign our position of the Chancellery and instead have an Austrian Nazi appointed as chancellor, Arthur Seyss-Inquart. While the referendum is a problem for him, we also face a problem ourselves: we can find no support from the British or French. The British ambassador, Nevile Henderson, has told Hitler that his claims against our nation are justified in principle, which, in turn, has emboldened the National Socialists in our country.\n\nWe have made various preparations for the upcoming referendum, such as getting rid of our one-party state, legalising our opposition party, the Social Democrats, as well as their trade union supporters. In return, they have guaranteed their support in the referendum. Also, a suggestion that was given to us to set the minimum voting age to 24 has been accepted as well. In the Reich, the voting age is lower as many young people are sympathetic to the Nazi ideology. We will take no risks in making sure that we win this plebiscite.\n\nHowever, not all goes to plan, and many wonder if our referendum will go ahead at all because of Hitler’s ultimatum. He has tried to derail our efforts by falsely accusing us that the vote will be a victim of fraud and not only that, but Nazi propaganda claims people have been rioting and that some are calling for German soldiers to restore order! We have already declared this to be wrong, but not everyone will listen.\n\nThe ultimatum is due to expire at noon, and our decision is final: we refuse Hitler’s demands. But without support for Austrian Independence from France or Britain, it might be best to hand in our resignation to President Wilhelm Miklas."

 GER_Anschluss.6.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]In what many have called an inevitable outcome, German troops finally entered Austria. This comes after the cancelling of the referendum organised by Chancellor Schuschnigg to preserve Austrian independence, German ‘insistence’ on the matter being almost a certainty. \n\nThe aftermath saw an ultimatum being received by Schuschnigg, in which Adolf Hitler demanded he hands over all power to the Austrian branch of the NSDAP or faces an invasion. Facing an untenable situation, and with no help coming from either the French or the British, the chancellor resigned. President Wilhelm Miklas initially refused to give in to the demands, but eventually realised the futility of his resistance and acquiesced.\n\nWehrmacht troops wasted no time, entering the territory of their ‘brothers’ unopposed by the Austrian Armed Forces, cheered by crowds waving flags.\n\nWidely condemned by the international community, repercussions are most likely not going to amount to any more than that. Many observers are of the opinion that the Germans would have invaded regardless of any plebiscite or armed resistance, so it can be said that Austria’s fate was sealed the moment the Führer decided to ‘unite’ all Germans."

With no support from other nations like Britain, France, and Italy, and the threat that we could come knocking on their door with thousands of soldiers, we expected them to agree to our demands. Alas, this is not the case, and they have instead decided to go ahead with their silly little referendum. But we can now accelerate our plans of Anschluss, and we shall order the immediate mobilisation of the 8th Army, who have been waiting for the order to be given to them. \n\nWithin Austria itself, we have instructed our close ally Arthur Seyss-Inquart, the Minister for the Interior, to mobilize supporters of the Austrian Nazi party to disrupt this act of defiance as much as possible. We have also called for the referendum to be postponed, or even better, cancelled altogether. \n\nWe have tried to reason with Schuschnigg, but all our options are exhausted. The ultimatum we sent has been profoundly ignored, even after extending the deadline by two hours. This is not only an insult to us and the Reich, but also an insult to all those inside Austria who see that their place in the world is together with Germany, for they feel German, and our path to the Anschluss has shown that no one will stop us from our ultimate goal: a united nation for all Germanic people. \n\nSo, send the troops to the border! Send the order to cause chaos within Austria with our loyal supporters based there! And most importantly, leave no room for any who dare stand in the way of the Reich, for they will feel the full might of our military power!"

The 8th Army proudly marches in the lands of our Austrian brothers, where they find crowds of patriots and supporters, waving the swastika and doing our salute. The Führer, no doubt excited about the endeavour, has decided to tour the newly acquired lands, but not before stopping at his birthplace. Braunau am Inn, located at the border, is the site of his parents’ graves and the place where he spent his childhood, so it must be quite dear to him. \n\nDuring the tour whose destination was Vienna, the enthusiasm of the population has somewhat baffled us. Truthfully, we were not expecting to have such widespread support among the Austrians, but it seems that our brothers have not forgotten their roots. And if they are so eager to be a part of the Third Reich, who are we to deny them the privilege?\n\nOriginally, we planned to install a friendly government with Chancellor Seyss-Inquart at its helm, but we now have the opportunity to outright incorporate Austria into our nation! A referendum shall be held next month to show the world that our southern brothers wish to be a part of Germany."

The referendum organised by the German government has turned out to be, unsurprisingly, in favour of Austrian ‘reunification’ with the Reich. With 99.7% of the voters saying ‘Ja’, all other complaints, be they about fairness or the lack of secrecy, are rendered insignificant.\n\nNow officially known as the province of Ostmark, the former territory of Austria will now be ruled directly by the NSDAP, with Seyss-Inquart as its governor. All over Germany, the population is jubilant, raising the already high popularity of Adolf Hitler to heights that would make any politician gawk.\n\nWith the matter of the ‘Anschluss’ being taken care of, international observers expect the Fuhrer to continue his quest to ‘unify’ all Germans. Dark clouds now gather over Czechoslovakia, home to a sizable German minority, the Sudetes. Although the Reich will lay dormant for a while in its foreign policy to avoid rousing the continent’s giants, it can be expected that eventually, Germany will turn its ravenous eyes towards their eastern neighbour.

As such, he has created a “call to arms” for all the people of Austria, to rise up and topple their authoritarian regime which cowardly hides under the guise of “democracy” and “republicanism”.

Chancellor Dollfuss of Austria was shot and killed by Otto Planetta, a former Austrian Nazi. A radio broadcast was shortly released, calling for Austrians to rise up and destroy the government. Aided by German weapons, former Austrian Nazis, and SS troops, the Austrian military and police forces were overwhelmed.

The Soviet Union, meanwhile, has frantically mobilized its troops for “regularly scheduled exercises”.\n\nRibbentrop has informed journalists that “the great nations of Deutschland and Italia have been bound together throughout history, and as such our alliance is merely a continuation of this tradition.” Ciano has also released a close parody of Ribbentrop, stating “Italia is marching towards a path of greatness and victory, as is Germany. Our mutual bond shall be strengthened through this pact, and as such we are now closer than ever to our allies in Berlin.”\n\nMany believe this is Germany gathering allies to prepare for the oncoming war.

The truck would make the deliveries easier, the renovations would make the house the pride of the neighborhood, and the tobacco pipe would replace his old one. What immediate use would a holiday have? It would all be over in just two weeks and he never had any interest in visiting foreign places, so in the end, the money would be wasted and he gained nothing from it.\n\nBut when he saw the Poster reading „Holiday on board the Der Deutsche. Hamburg-Neapel-Palmero-Bari-Venice. 2,50RM per day per Person.“ he suddenly yearned for sun and relaxation. He had some concern about the price since it was still a large amount of money, but with the companies reopening in the city and his increase in income, it was well within the possible. His children were either grown up and Anton his youngest spend most of his time in school and in the Hitler youth anyways. The farm would certainly survive for two weeks without him. So, during mass, he pondered. Why not? Surely he and his wife deserved it and it would be a nice sign for her, showing her that the poverty and turmoil of the Weimar years were over.\n\nSo the next Friday he made a small detour during his usual deliveries to the city, going to the local KdF-office and buying 2 tickets, hoping that his wife would be as thrilled as he was. And thrilled she was, crying tears of joy when he presented her with the tickets. And so the two of them would go on Holiday for the first time in their life.\n\nNow three months he laid beside his wife on the beach, smiling to himself and thanking his past self for taking the time to read the poster on his way to church.

This would also result in the Wehrmacht rearmament programs stalling, which would allow the “two hate-inspired antagonists”, Britain and France to catch up in terms of production, a potentially fatal mistake if it were allowed to happen.\n\nThis fiery and aggressive rhetoric is surely a sign of things to come..."

What is that supposed to be?“\n“I thought you were informed of the creation of the Luftwaffen-Felddivisionen?“\n“I was not. What are they?“\n“Well, they are comprised of Luftwaffen-personnel. On the organizational level, they differ only slightly from a normal infantry-division.“\n“If they don't differ why are they not integrated into the Heer? Half of my divisions are understrength! They should be sent to existing divisions before they raise new divisions for the sake of it!“\n“They originally planned to do exactly that. But Reichsmarschall Göring intervened and argued for the soldiers to be still under the supervision of the Luftwaffe. And since creating new Luftwaffe-companies inside Heer-divisions was impractical they decided to create new divisions.“\n“Ugh of course. From where are the commanding officers?“\n“The Luftwaffe.“\n“So no combat-experience. Great. What about the troops themselves? Were they at least trained sufficiently?“\n“The officers received an infantry-combat course. The soldiers themselves are expected to be trained at the front.“\n“[...]Very well.

It condemned the Reich Government, never mentioning the Nazi party by name, but mentions a \"Mad Prophet,\" likely alluding to the Führer, of spreading \"pantheistic confusion\" across the German people, and though it does admit that race is a fundamental value of human communities, a necessary and honorable effort, it also states that the exaltation of blood and race, or the state, should not go beyond the standard levels, lest they become idolatry."

Herr Heydrich, who was driving to a meeting with the Führer in Berlin, noticed the two Czech nationals, ready to claim his life after a hairpin turn in the Libeň district, and ordered his driver to slow down, before leaving the vehicle and confronting them both. Heroically, the Reichsprotektor eliminated the first partisan, whose machine-gun malfunctioned, before shooting the second in the arm, who found himself inside the blast of his own explosive.

The boat was able to leave when the red flag was no longer flying, and the riot soon dissipated after that. The German Government was quick to denounce the incident, citing that this is an act of aggression, and demanded the arrest of those involved. However, US authorities have said, “No symbol of Germany had been harmed”.\n\nHowever, the fact stills stand that these protestors took down a symbol almost foreign to the German identity. As such, these protestors were not anti-German, but anti-National Socialist. But, as the months drag on, these two ideas seem to become closer together, and they may soon be indistinguishable.

The German government, of course, condemned the actions of these agitators and rightfully requested the apprehension of those involved. However, according to the US authorities, no symbol of Germany was damaged as the protestors 'merely' tore down the flag of the Nazi party. This incident is a travesty beyond words, and our international relations with the US have been hampered by their insult to our national dignity.\n\nThe German government has been forced to remove the Imperial German flag as a co-national flag to prevent another incident like this from occurring again - and understandable measure, but one that shouldn't have been needed.

 Germany_Sweden.1.d: "National-Socialism has proven to be successfully implemented in Sweden, making its people aware of their pan-Germanic destiny. It is up to Berlin to implement a full annexation of Danish society, thereby turning Sweden into a province of the Reich."
 Germany_Sweden.1.A: "Welcome to the Reich"
 Germany_Sweden.1.B: "Keep it as a puppet"

 Germany_Heims_in_Reich.1.t: "Reichsgau Danzig-Westpreußen"
 Germany_Heims_in_Reich.1.d: "After the Great War Danzig became a Free City under international mandate, whereas the surrounding land was granted to Poland. These lands have been predominantly German and by reinstating Danzig-Westpreußen as an administrative unit of the Reich its nationality can be guaranteed."
 Germany_Heims_in_Reich.1.A: "Welcome Home"

 Germany_Heims_in_Reich.2.t: "(Ausdehnung) Gau Oberschlesien"
 Germany_Heims_in_Reich.2.d: "Eastern Silesia was lost to Poland after the World War, even though the plebiscite showed that a majority voted to remain with Germany. This lost region is once again incorporated into Upper Silesia, adding also the Olsagebiet, a historical part of Silesia proper. By settling Volksdeutsche in the areas through the Heim ins Reich program it will prove to be a valuable asset to the new Reich."
 Germany_Heims_in_Reich.2.A: "Welcome Home"

 Germany_Heims_in_Reich.3.t: "(Ausdehnung) Gau Ostpreußen"
 Germany_Heims_in_Reich.3.d: "When the Memelland was forcefully annexed by Lithuania it was destined to return under Prussian administration, which will undo the Lithuanisation of the region in the past decades. Furthermore, the region to the south up to the Weichsel River will be administered by Königsberg. This land was held by Prussia for a brief period during the Napoleonic era, but will see itself integrated into the new Reich by German settlers from all over Europe."
 Germany_Heims_in_Reich.3.A: "Welcome Home"

 Germany_Heims_in_Reich.4.t: "Reichsgau Wartheland"
 Germany_Heims_in_Reich.4.d: "This new Reichsgau will be made up of the lost parts of Posen and the region around Lodz. By attracting and resettling Germans from Eastern and South-eastern Europe we can strive towards full Germanisation of the Warthe basin."
 Germany_Heims_in_Reich.4.A: "Welcome Home"

 Germany_Heims_in_Reich.5.t: "Untersteiermark & Oberkrain"
 Germany_Heims_in_Reich.5.d: "Northern Slovenia, belonged to the Austrian monarchy as crownlands, namely Styria and Krain. Since these lands have fallen back into German hands the Führer has stated that 'these lands were to become German once more'. Volksdeutsche from South-east Germany are being hauled in to change the character of the region."
 Germany_Heims_in_Reich.5.A: "Welcome Home"


 Germany_Staatenbund.1.t: "European Confederation"
 Germany_Staatenbund.1.d: "Calls for unification can no longer be ignored; in the past few months people have become uneasy with the current status of Austria as a mere puppet of Germany. By reorganising the Ostmark in several Reichsgau it can easily be absorbed by Germany."
 Germany_Staatenbund.1.A: "Accede the Bund"
 Germany_Staatenbund.1.B: "We're not interested"

 Germany.7.t: "Tyrol remains divided"
 Germany.7.d: "The Italians have reiterated that South Tyrol remains an Italian province, thereby maintaining the status quo established since the aftermath of the World War. It is clear that Tyrol will never be united, and the Volksdeutsche in the region will have to be resettled in the Empire, with possible locations in the Crimea or in Franche Comté."
 Germany.7.A: "There's little we can do about it"

 Germany.8.t: "Tyrol has been united"
 Germany.8.d: "Since South Tyrol is predominantly German it belongs in the Empire, united with their fellow brethren in Innsbruck. This finally settles any conflicts Germany has in the region. In return, Germany has ceded the Italian speaking regions of Switzerland, thereby fulfilling Italian dreams of union."
 Germany.8.A: "Süd-Tiroler Heimkehr!"

 Germany.33.t: "Großgermanisches Reich"
 Germany.33.d: "In one of his speeches the Führer has proclaimed a new phase in the thousand year Reich. Not only has Bolshevism been defeated, also the last of the continental Germanics \"Festlandgermanen\", in the Netherlands and Flanders, have rejoined the Reich. With the new direction of empire-building, the Großgermanisches Reich proclaims to be the home of all of Germans."
 Germany.33.A: "Heil Germanien!"

 Germany.35.t: "Fate of the British Empire"
 Germany.35.d: "Albion has fallen, and the breakup of the British Empire is almost a reality. Through the centuries the Anglo-Saxons have built up an impressive Imperium, spanning to all four corners of the globe. Preserving it would most likely turn the British into a valuable ally, still ruling the waves."
 Germany.35.A: "Preserve the Empire"
 Germany.35.B: "Establish an occupation policy"

 Germany.37.t: "Cinematography from the Reich"
 Germany.37.d: "Films from the Babelsberg Studio have been flooding our cinemas in the last few years, gaining ever more popularity. The youth have been seen taking over elements of the language and culture shown, but above all the ideological undercurrents omnipresent in the cinematography are doing their intended purpose. Cultural ministers are posing the question whether Babelsberg films should be restricted and some of them even prohibited from being shown. Such a move would damage our relations however..."
 Germany.37.A: "Accept the Films"
 Germany.37.B: "Reject the Films"

 Germany.38.t: "Destroying the Maginot Line"
 Germany.38.d: "After the German conquest of France, Hitler ordered the once-feared Maginot Line to be dismantled."
 Germany.38.A: "Tear down that wall!"

 GER_RK.6.d: "Iceland has come under German military supervision, which has quickly assumed control of all civil administrative organs. Generals and Ministers believe that the Icelandic people can be entrusted running their own limited form of government, under Germany's watchful eyes of course."
 GER_RK.6.A: "Establish the Reichsprotektorat."
 GER_RK.6.B: "Continue Military Occupation."

 GER_RK.7.t: "Reichsprotektorat Schweland"
 GER_RK.7.d: "The Swedes now find themselves under National Socialist rule and have accommodated to the occupiers, having seemingly made peace with their fate. In the short run it would be wise to hand over the general affairs of the country from the army back to the administrators."
 GER_RK.7.A: "Establish the Reichsprotektorat."
 GER_RK.7.B: "Continue Military Occupation."

 GER_RK.11.t: "Extend the Generalgouvernement Polen"
 GER_RK.11.d: "We control the states further to the east of the Generalgouvernement Polen and it might be a good idea to let them deal with those states. Shall we give them governance of the area?"
 GER_RK.11.A: "Extend it's sphere of governance"
 GER_RK.11.B: "We will occupy it"

 GER_RK.12.t: "SS-Staat Burgund Demands More Land"
 GER_RK.12.d: "Himmler has approached us with his demands to expand SS-Staat Burgund from the North Sea to as far south as possible to reach the Mediterranean. Should we allow him to gain more influence in Western Europe, or is it deemed too risky?"
 GER_RK.12.A: "From Sea to Sea"
 GER_RK.12.B: "Himmler Asks for to much"

 ### SS Events
 GER_SS.1.t: "Generals protest the deployment of the SS Dispositional Troops"
 GER_SS.1.d: "Even though the creation of the SS-Verfügungstruppe has only been announced recently, it seems that several generals of the Heer have already written letters to the Führer himself, protesting against the “creation of parallel command structures“ and the “attack against the authority of OKW,” while simultaneously raising concern over the growing rivalry between the SS and the Wehrmacht.\n\nWhile the generals in question have so far refrained from taking action against the creation of the Verfügungstruppe, mostly due to their respect for the Führer, the letter hints that several generals will consider immediate retirement should a certain line be crossed. Despite the situation itself not being a serious matter yet, the Führer is still aware that a decision has to be made to show both the SS and the OKW what the appropriate direction will be in the near future.\n\nTo announce this new party line, we could either try to placate the generals by promising them that no new armed SS-Formations will be set up or we could remind the generals of their boundaries, showing that any future objection to the Führer's orders will simply not be tolerated."
 GER_SS.1.A: "Ease the Generals' fears."
 GER_SS.1.A.tt: "The SS-Verfügungstruppe will remain the only of its kind.\nAll future plans for the §gSchutzstaffel§!'s expansion are put to halt\n"
 GER_SS_Expansion_Halted: "§gSchutzstaffel§! Expansion Halted"
 GER_SS.1.B: "Remind the Generals of their boundaries!"
 GER_SS.1.B.tt: "The Führer will order and they shall follow."

 GER_SS.2.t: "Neither of the Army, Nor of the Police"
 GER_SS.2.d: "The official ceremony congratulating the formation of the Waffen-SS was a normal event, with a similar ceremony being a daily occurrence in Hitler's new Germany.\n\nA few hundred men standing in uniform and attention, the Führer giving a speech and more men in fancier uniforms surrounding the Führer on the stage.\n\nHowever, a particularly mindful observer in the crowd could make out the tension and the cracks showing themselves between the fancy uniforms on the stage:\n\nWhy were the Officers of the Wehrmacht all huddled together on the left side of the stage, staring blankly into the crowd, while only sticking their heads together to exchange few words through gritted teeth?\n\nWhy were the SS leaders doing their best to ignore said Officers? Why did the impression of a thin, smug smile creep over Himmler's face, when shaking von Blomberg's hand?\n\nWhy did the Führer himself look uncomfortable, gazing uneasy towards both the Wehrmacht and the SS, as if a brawl was to break out any second from now? Why did he put special emphasis on the fact, that Himmler was neither Chief of the Army nor the police?"
 GER_SS.2.A: "Why are there daggers in men's smiles?"

 SS_Recruitment.1.t: "French SS-Freiwillige"
 SS_Recruitment.1.d: "In this titanic struggle of national survival, we must use every asset and every advantage. The SS believes that there are many in France who would gladly pick up arms and fight by our side against the threat of global Bolshevism.\n\nWhile the Wehrmacht agrees in principle that some recruitment of suitable volunteers could be useful, the Generals in the OKW very strongly believe that any foreign volunteers should be under military - not SS - command."

 SS_Recruitment.9.A: "Fund a massive recruitment campaign for the SS."

 SS_Recruitment.10.t: "Generals protest"
 SS_Recruitment.10.d: "In a meeting with [GER.GetLeader] today, a number of high-ranking Wehrmacht officers in the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht have voiced their concerns about what they term \"political favouritism\" on the behalf of the SS. In particular, they are watching the development of a parallel armed force in the Waffen-SS with deep worry.\n\nThe lavishly equipped SS-Divisions, their argument continues, only take away desperately needed resources from the regular military.\n\nFinally, independent recruitment could lead to separate command structures, leading to a separation of efforts when all force needs to be bundled to achieve final victory."
 SS_Recruitment.10.A: "This interference in political matters is unbecoming of German officers."
 SS_Recruitment.10.B: "Assure them that the OKW has final command of all SS forces."

 SS_Recruitment.11.t: "General resigns in protest"
 SS_Recruitment.11.d: "Citing poor health, [GER_SS_general_resigns.GetName] has resigned his commission immediately. It is, however, an open secret that [GER_SS_general_resigns.GetName] was an outspoken critic of the government's policy regarding the Waffen-SS, particular the decision to allow foreign volunteers to serve in SS Divisions. Reportedly, [GER_SS_general_resigns.GetName] insisted on saying his goodbyes to the Führer in person, which led to a heated discussion between the two about the allocation of resources in the war effort.\n\nSeveral other officers in the Wehrmacht have voiced similar concerns, and some have indicated that they might consider following him."
 SS_Recruitment.11.A: "Good, he left before he could infect others with his weakness."
 SS_Recruitment.11.B: "Try to convince him that his duty outweighs all else."

 SS_Recruitment.12.t: "Rumors of a Wehrmacht Plot"
 SS_Recruitment.12.desc: "The Gestapo has produced a new and very disturbing report. Apparently, a group of high-ranking Wehrmacht officers has started to have regular meetings in a remote mansion somewhere in East Prussia.\n\nDisguised as a regular Bridge playing session, these meetings have been going on for at least several months now and seem to feature a very select circle of officers. Security Services have so far been unable to get a man on the inside, but all officers confirmed to be connected to this \"Prussian Circle\" have been very outspoken about their disdain of the National Socialist government and particular its decision to expand the Waffen-SS.\n\nThere is currently little indication of what the ultimate goal of this plot is, or if indeed it has a goal at all."
 SS_Recruitment.12.A: "Just a few old soldiers grumbling."
 SS_Recruitment.12.B: "Lecture the OKW on the importance of loyalty in the struggle for national survival."

 SS_Recruitment.13.t: "Assassination attempt on [GER.GetLeader]"
 SS_Recruitment.13.d: "Unconfirmed reports from Führer Headquarters indicate that someone set off an explosive device during a situation meeting that [GER.GetLeader] attended. Information is still sparse, and there is considerable confusion in both the Wehrmacht and the SS, with officers on both sides accusing the other of attempting to execute a coup.\n\nWe will have to wait for more information."
 SS_Recruitment.13.A: "We can only hope."

 SS_Recruitment.14.t: "Unternehmen Walküre"
 SS_Recruitment.14.d: "Elements of the Wehrmacht have executed Operation Valkyrie, the contingency plan for major civil unrest in Germany. Army units have surrounded a number of government ministries and attempted to arrest high-ranking officials of the party. Small-scale skirmishes and firefights between SS-guard details and Army detachments have been reported all across Berlin. It appears that the Wehrmacht has demanded that all SS units stand down immediately and hand over the weapons, which SS leadership has refused outright.\n\nBoth factions currently struggle for control of Berlin. Parts of the Wehrmacht have declared their loyalty to [GER.GetLeader] and taken up arms against the rebels.\n\nThe conflagration of this war is only going to spread."
 SS_Recruitment.14.A: "Verräter! Versager!"

 SS_Recruitment.15.t: "[GER.GetLeader] survives assassination attempt"
 SS_Recruitment.15.d: "Fortune - or providence - seems to favor [GER.GetLeader], as the bomb blast in his headquarters only slightly injured him. Several others near him were not as lucky.\n\nAfter receiving medical treatment for a few minor burns and superficial cuts, [GER.GetLeader] immediately met with representatives of the party, the SS and the Gestapo to discuss further steps."
 SS_Recruitment.15.A: "Traitors die a traitor's death."
 SS_Recruitment.15.B: "Let them redeem themselves through service."

 SS_Recruitment.20.t: "Himmler Protests"
 SS_Recruitment.20.d: "In a private meeting between Heinrich Himmler and [GER.GetLeader], the Reichsführer-SS reportedly complained loudly and repeatedly that his organisation has not received the support it needs to do the necessary work of defending the party and the state. He further warned [GER.GetLeader] against trusting the Wehrmacht to remain loyal.\n\nOnly the SS could be trusted to bring about the new Germany."
 SS_Recruitment.20.A: "He forgets his place."
 SS_Recruitment.20.B: "A smaller force ensures that only the best of our people wear this mantle of honor."

 SS_Recruitment.21.t: "The Knights of the Wewelsburg"
 SS_Recruitment.21.d: "Reports have arrived that Himmler has called the upper leadership of the SS to Wewelsburg castle for urgent consultations. The exact contents of these consultations are unknown, but it stands to reason that they are connected to the continued frustrations of Himmler with the leadership of the party. [GER.GetLeader] still seems to follow the advice of the Wehrmacht when it comes to military matters, blocking Himmler's attempts at creating and expanding an independent armed force as a counterweight.\n\nRumor has it that Himmler has instead turned his attention towards creating what he calls \"a new Order of Teutonic Knights for a new Germany\". These Knights swear fanatical loyalty and unquestioning obedience to Himmler personally and are each gifted a sword made to Himmler's design from steel blessed in old Germanic rituals - presumably to slay the enemies of the New Germany."
 SS_Recruitment.21.A: "What nonsense!"
 SS_Recruitment.21.B: "Remind Himmler who he is supposed to be loyal to."

 SS_Recruitment.22.t: "SS interferes in the war economy"
 SS_Recruitment.22.d: "The government has received a number of complaints from several factory managers. They received orders for materials from an 'SS Office of Construction and Procurement'. Upon delivery, they were sent to an 'SS Office of Financial Affairs', which was supposed to pay them, but instead forwarded them further to an 'SS Office for Economic Cooperation', where they were told that the original office was supposed to pay them directly.\n\nPerhaps even more disturbing are the materials ordered - precision machinery, large amounts of chemicals used to make fertilizer as well as quantities of steel and sheet metal.\n\nHimmler has refused to discuss these events with government officials, but was overheard talking to a high-ranking SS liaison officer in the Ministry of Economic Affairs, saying that 'if [GER.GetLeader] won't give me guns, I will just have to build my own. I don't care where or how I get what I need for that.'"
 SS_Recruitment.22.A: "Surely this was just an accounting error."
 SS_Recruitment.22.B: "Force Himmler to do a full investigation and report the findings in person."

 SS_Recruitment.23.t: "The Himmler Plot"
 SS_Recruitment.23.d: "An anonymous source high inside the SS has leaked an internal memo to the government. Its contents are nothing less than explosive. Over dozens of pages, it details how the SS could use its diminished but still substantial powers to seize control over the government 'in the event that [GER.GetLeader] betrays the National Socialist cause'. Evidence for such a betrayal, the paper continues, would be a lack of commitment to replacing existing obsolete organisations such as the Army with new formations built in the right National Socialist character.\n\nThe memo bears the signature of Heinrich Himmler."
 SS_Recruitment.23.A: "We can not challenge the SS."
 SS_Recruitment.23.B: "He has gone too far this time."
 SS_Recruitment.23.C: "Perhaps some kind of accommodation might be found?"

 SS_Recruitment.24.d: "Reports have arrived from Führer Headquarters, claiming that some sort of commotion broke out during a private meeting between [GER.GetLeader] and Heinrich Himmler. Details are sparse, but the military intelligence service, the Abwehr, claims to have intercepted a secret courier carrying orders to a number of SS units all across Germany to prepare for something called 'Fall Schwarz', allegedly an operation to seize control of key communications and infrastructure points in the case of an attempted military coup."
 SS_Recruitment.24.A: "Germany's fate hangs in the balance."

 SS_Recruitment.25.d: "Once more, fate has held its hand over [GER.GetLeader] and protected him from harm. As the Führer himself tells it, Himmler pulled his gun on him during a private meeting, screaming insults and obscenities. Clearly overtaken by his lust for power, the Reichsführer-SS tried to kill [GER.GetLeader], but the gun jammed and didn't fire. In the moment of confusion, the Führer managed to overpower Himmler and shout for help. Reportedly, it took four members of his guard detail to restrain Himmler.\n\nElsewhere in the Reich, a number of tense standoffs between SS and regular Army units ensued as the former attempted to seize key communication posts but eventually withdrew after hearing that [GER.GetLeader] had survived.\n\nWehrmacht units have the main SS offices and holdings surrounded and are awaiting orders from Berlin."
 SS_Recruitment.25.A: "Should have shot them all years ago, like Stalin did!"
 SS_Recruitment.25.B: "And still, they remain untouchable."

 SS_Recruitment.26.t: "The Himmler-Putsch"
 SS_Recruitment.26.d: "As the smoke in the Führer Headquarters cleared, Heinrich Himmler emerged from the chaotic firefight as the sole survivor. According to his testimony, the Führer, clearly gripped by madness, had declared him a complete failure of a man and a soldier, a traitor and a spy to be shot at dawn. Realizing that he must choose between his personal honor and the survival of the nation, Himmler decided to act immediately and shot him. In the aftermath, members of the Führer's guard detail attempted to kill Himmler as an assassin. Only the timely arrival of Himmler's own bodyguards saved the Reichsführer-SS.\n\n Across Germany, the news of the death of the Führer has evidently served as a signal to put long-prepared into action. Both SS and regular Army units raced to secure bridges, telephone exchanges and crossroads, with Luftwaffe paratroopers rapidly mobilizing to seize airfields all across the Reich.\n\nGermany stands at the edge of a civil war, and all three factions will rely on the civilian government to actually run the country."
 SS_Recruitment.26.A: "The government will back Himmler."
 SS_Recruitment.26.B: "The government will back Göring."
 SS_Recruitment.26.C: "Ask the Wehrmacht to restore order."

 Germany_special.1.d: "With Poland in the east and France in the west, Germany is wedged in between hostile powers. While our enemies still cling on to the defensive, immobile warfare of the past, the German armed forces will coordinate their attacks to force a decisive breakthrough. Success will render useless all remaining enemy defensive positions, instead forcing them to respond to our continual offensive. Only the new Blitzkrieg strategy will grant us victory, and thereby prevents us from fighting in a two front war.."

 Germany_special.2.d: "Having recently purged its officer corps, reports tell us that the Soviet union is currently on the brink of collapse. This status quo will not exist for much longer, as 3 army groups are marching east until reaching the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line. First they must win the border battles with the Red Army, after which each will take their first objectives of Leningrad, Moscow, and Kiev, to eventually secure the rich oil fields in the south. Or as the Führer said 'You only have to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down.'"

The conquest of Europe has been a stunning success, but we have to defend our territory with tooth and nail. Germany is adamant to turn the continent into an impregnable fortress. However this won’t be sufficient, as our intelligence warns that the Soviets and Western Allies heavily outnumber the Axis, by manpower and by industrial production. The only way to even out the playing field is through the development of superior weaponry."

 GER_Trade_Agreement_USSR.1.t: "Germany Proposes a Agreement"
 GER_Trade_Agreement_USSR.1.d: "It is no secret that we possess a huge abundance of natural resources such as oil, iron ore and tin, materials which the Germans in the West require for their war effort. While we have already been trading with them since the German-Soviet Credit Agreement was signed in August 1939, their foreign minister Ribbentrop has outlined plans for further economic cooperation between our two nations. His proposals include increased exports of our raw materials to Germany, which would total about 1.3 billion Reichsmarks, and in return, this would be paid for with not only Reichsmarks but also in capital and consumer goods, something which we need for our ever-growing economy. The agreement would also pave the way for “Joint German-Soviet Economic Planning”, which would be beneficial for both of our countries.\n\nWhile this all sounds good, it does seem to be weighted in Germany’s favour, so demanding more from them would be a good negotiating idea. Should we decide to agree to this deal, we could ask for war material, such as a warship from them, and maybe even designs for other ships that we could build. If the Germans can guarantee this, then we shall accept the deal in its entirety."
 GER_Trade_Agreement_USSR.1.A: "We Can Benefit From This Agreement; We Shall Accept It."
 GER_Trade_Agreement_USSR.1.B.: "This Will Help the Germans More Than Us; We Refuse!"

 GER_Trade_Agreement_USSR.2.t: "The Soviet Union Agrees to a Trade Agreement"
 GER_Trade_Agreement_USSR.2.d: "We have received good news from the Soviet Union! After many discussions and much disagreement over what the final terms should be, we and the Soviets are now content with what we will both get out of this deal, and they have agreed to sign the Commercial Agreement. The Soviets will send us raw materials worth 650 million Reichsmarks in total, while we will send them 650 million Reichsmarks worth of technology, consumer goods, and industrial machinery. The raw materials will be particularly useful in helping us bypass the British blockade that is stopping us from acquiring resources that are crucial to the war effort.\n\nAs well as the exchange of raw materials and other goods, we will be providing the Soviets with several pieces of naval equipment and technology, including the cruiser Lützow and the plans for our upcoming battleship Bismarck, along with a plethora of other military equipment such as warplanes and samples of tanks and artillery. The most crucial part of the agreement for us is the oil we will be receiving from them, as we do not have a large surplus of fuel for our army, and without this agreement, we would not be able to import much more because of the blasted British blockade. \n\nBut we do not have to worry about it too much now, as trade with the USSR has opened more opportunities to get our resources from somewhere else."
 GER_Trade_Agreement_USSR.2.A: "If You Could Sign On the Line Here, Please…"

 GER_Trade_Agreement_USSR.3.t: "The Soviet Union Refuses"
 GER_Trade_Agreement_USSR.3.d: "Verdammt! Those wretched Bolsheviks have refused the trade agreement we have put forward. The negotiations have been long and hard, with an unfortunate reply from the Soviets saying that they will not cooperate with us, and that what we proposed was “nothing short of a fascistic scam”. Despite allowing them to have access to some of our naval and military designs, as well as increasing the amount of goods and machinery that we would be sending them, the Soviet delegation informed us that this was short of what they were expecting, and therefore they could not pursue the deal.\n\nThis is surprising, as we have negotiated with the Soviets in the past, most notably the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, but it appears that was as far as they were willing to go. What is more disappointing however is that we will not be able to trade with them for much needed resources such as oil, which our army desperately requires as the British blockade has cut us off from oil-producing nations like the USA. Although maybe it is our fault for trusting those lying Soviets in the first place…"
 GER_Trade_Agreement_USSR.3.A: "We Must Find Other Ways to Secure Our Trade."

 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.1.t: "Germany Asks for Reinforced Ties..."
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.1.d: "The German Embassy in Moscow has approached us today with a letter personally signed by Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Foreign Minister of Germany and one of the main architects behind the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the current political and economical agreement between our two countries.\n\nIn the letter, Ribbentrop has officially invited a diplomatic mission to Berlin, to deepen the ties between our countries and convince us to enter the war on the side of the Axis powers.\n\nWhile Politburo is interested in continuing our relationship with Germany, the negotiations will still be difficult to pull off with many conflicting interests needing to be resolved. Furthermore, several voices in the government distrust Germany entirely and thus oppose our entry into the war.\n\nHowever it remains up to General Secretary Stalin to agree on our stance towards Germany- will we keep a distance from this conflict or should the Soviet Union play an active role in the creation of a new Europe?"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.1.A: "Sent a Letter to Ribbentrop. We Will Attend the Conference"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.1.B: "This Is Too Dangerous. Refuse."

 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.2.t: "Soviets put an halt to the negotiations."
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.2.d: "The silence of the bleak morning hours was broken by radio static. Over the radio, an order is given to a division of the Berlin Schutzstaffel.\n\n“Negotiations have broken down. We’re sending a Soviet back to his homeland.”\n\nMorning turns to midday, and Molotov is escorted to the train station to leave Berlin. Buried deep in his briefcase, diplomatic papers detailing a German-Soviet alliance leaves with him. With his departure, any hope for future German-Soviet cooperation has also been forcefully quashed.\n\nOne officer in the SS speaks as the door shuts, “I don’t know what he was in the Reich for, but I’m glad Communists like him are getting kicked out. Though, I would’ve preferred to kill him.”\n\nMany in his division share this sentiment; perhaps our attempts at negotiation were doomed from the start."
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.2.A: "How foolish we were to think those communists would cooperate..."

 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.3.t: "Molotov in Berlin"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.3.d: "Vyacheslav Molotov was a cautious man. As a writer for Pravda- back when even holding a copy was a one-way ticket to Siberia, and not the state newspaper of a nation of 170 million- he had learned the value of caution. Few reckless revolutionaries survived back in the days of the Tsar.\n\nAs the screaming of the train's brakes became a whimper, the thick grey smoke dissipated, revealing the dull square tiles of the platform and the glossy black boots of the German delegation that awaited him.\n\nBerlin. The vipers' nest.\n\nThe former lance corporal who now rules this country once wrote of an inevitable war between Germany and the Russian people- a war of extermination, where the winner would achieve nothing less than \"permanent mastery of the world.\" That man had made it clear that his side would do everything in their power to win. And now that man had invited Molotov here, to the center of his empire, to negotiate over lunch. How could one negotiate with men that consider him less than human?\n\nAs Molotov stepped out onto the platform, the leader of the German team stepped forward, making a short remark in his mother tongue. Molotov's translator took an uncomfortably long moment to exchange the German words for Russian ones and then turned back to the Soviets.\n\n\"Welcome to Berlin, Mr. Molotov.\"\n\nA smile spread across the German's face, and he held out an eagle-cuffed right hand. Molotov shook it and smiled back."
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.3.A: "We wish him a great trip!"

 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.4.t: "Molotov Seen in Berlin!"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.4.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.4.A: "Very concerning"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.4.B: "This was supposed to be a discrete meeting"

 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.5.t: "Soviets interest in Turkey"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.5.d: "Since the time of the Tsars, Russia has pursued a warm water port to project its power overseas, failing time and time again to secure port facilities that can remain in operation during the cold Russian winters. The port at Sevastopol, located on the Crimean Peninsula in the Black Sea, could serve this purpose- if it weren't for the narrows at the Bosporus and Dardanelles commanding entry into the Mediterranean.\n\nShould the Soviet Union take control of these straits, either directly or by adding Turkey to their sphere of influence, the Bolsheviks will have achieved something no previous Russian government had managed to do- establish Russia as a credible naval power.\n\nAs part of our negotiations with the Soviet Union, the Soviet delegation has come to us demanding that they should be allowed to take control of the straits.\n\nWhile this would allow the Soviets to challenge the British in the eastern Mediterranean, it would certainly enrage the Italians, who have their territorial designs in the region. Finally, many within the party are opposed to any Soviet territorial expansion whatsoever, especially one with such far-reaching implications.\n\nControl of the straits is no doubt the Soviet delegation's highest priority- should we deny them this, they will most likely break off negotiations entirely."
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.5.A: "The Mediterranean is not our priority. Let them have the straits."
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.5.B: "This is unacceptable."

 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.6.t: "Germany refuses to recognise our Interests"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.6.d: "Today our delegation in Berlin wired us a message that disappointed many but surprised few- the Germans have rejected our claim to the straits.\n\nPerhaps it was ridiculous to think we could ever negotiate with the Germans, who have long been virulent anti-communists; Hitler himself outlines his particular hatred for our nation in Mein Kampf.\n\nWith our most important demand flatly denied, there is little reason to continue negotiations. Our delegation will take the first train from Berlin."
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.6.A: "The search for a warm water port continues"

 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.7.t: "Soviets interest in Bulgaria"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.7.d: "The straits at the Bosporus and Dardanelles are Russia's link to the world, and essential for the security and prosperity of the Soviet state. For this purpose, they must be defended against any power hostile to the USSR, which brings the Soviet-Axis talks to the subject of Bulgaria.\n\nMolotov's Soviet delegation claims that Germany must allow the USSR to strengthen its influence in Bulgaria, suggesting that Soviet troops be allowed to travel through the country and make use of its ports and bases. In return, Germany and the Soviet Union would issue a joint guarantee for Bulgaria to prevent any further loss of territory.\n\nWhile Bulgaria holds only minor strategic utility for us, it may prove wise in the long term to deny the Soviets this request. Growing closer to one Balkan nation will certainly antagonize its neighbors, and with the addition of Italian interests in the area, Bulgaria may prove more trouble than it's worth.\n\nOn the other hand, continued cooperation with the Soviet Union could prove extremely valuable going forward, and Bulgaria may be a small price to pay."
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.7.A: "We will allow the Soviets to influence Bulgaria"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.7.B: "We need a compromise. How about docking rights?"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.7.C: "We won't sell Bulgaria."

 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.8.t: "Germany offers Docking Rights in Bulgaria"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.8.d: "Our negotiations with Germany have proven far more successful than anyone in Moscow or Berlin could have hoped, but there are still many subjects to be discussed and agreements to be ironed out.\n\nOne such point of contention in the case of Bulgaria. We had hoped we would be allowed to influence Bulgaria to protect our interests in the Black Sea, but the Germans have proven reluctant to part with the small Balkan nation.\n\nOur delegation delivered Moscow's request, and after a short recess, the German diplomatic team returned to the table to say our full demands are unacceptable to their government. However, they are willing to grant us a compromise; docking rights at Bulgarian ports. While it's not quite what we wanted, docking rights are certainly better than nothing, and compromising here could open the door to more favorable resolutions down the line.\n\nOur delegation is waiting for a response from Moscow. What shall we tell them?"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.8.A: "Compromise is a sign of goodwill. Docking rights are enough."
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.8.B: "Compromise is a sign of weakness. Break off talks."

 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.9.t: "Germany offers Bulgaria"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.9.d: "Good news from Berlin! Foreign Minister Molotov has informed us by telegram that the Germans will allow the Soviet Union to expand its influence in Bulgaria. Georgi Dimitrov, head of the Comintern and a Bulgarian, was reportedly thrilled to hear he may finally be able to return to his homeland after over a decade of exile.\n\nAligning this small Balkan state will serve our interest in defending the Black Sea, and a presence in Bulgaria will allow us to start making contact with communist groups in Greece and Yugoslavia.\n\nWhen the Germans invited us to talks in Berlin, many in Moscow were suspicious- the Nazis have never been subtle about their hatred of communism. However, our recent diplomatic breakthroughs with the Reich have many in the politburo wondering if the Germans have finally managed to temper their chauvinism."
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.9.A: "Perhaps we have more in common than we thought"

 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.10.t: "The Romanian Question"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.10.d: "Now that we've moved past the early hurdles, it's time to tackle one of the bigger problems at the conference that can't be dealt with by halves: Romania. The country ruled by King Carol has long since been a battleground between the Soviets and Germans, and so a decision of Romania's fate must be taken.\n\nThe delegates have both agreed there are two options: Romania with the Germans, or Romania with the Soviets. Concessions have been made by Molotov that if Romania toes the socialist line, Transylvania shall be transferred to Horthy’s Hungary. We shall have to decide what the fate of Romania will be soon, otherwise, the Soviet delegates shall sense our indecisiveness and act.\n\nThe clock strikes 11, and so we must make our decision. Shall Romania be Deutsche or Russian?"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.10.A: "Romania shall stand with us!"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.10.B: "Let Romania be Stalin's chew toy."

 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.11.t: "Germany gives us Romania"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.11.d: "We have struck gold in our talks! The fascists have agreed to surrender the monarchist outpost of Romania to our influence. King Carol and his imperialist lackeys shall be run out of the country, and a people's government shall be formed for the Romanian worker. Of course, the matter of Transylvania going to Horthy and his reactionaries is sickening, however, compromises must be made in order to achieve our goals.\n\nMolotov has reported back he is surprised by the cooperation of the German delegation, and that he has made much headway for the Soviet Union in terms of progress. He believes that we could possibly push for more concessions, and even demand control of the Bosporus Strait. Progress has been made, and so the conference shall continue."
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.11.A: "Fabulous! Let's hope the Germans stay this cooperative until the conference's end"

 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.12.t: "Germany keeps Romania"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.12.d: "Unfortunately, whilst we can gain concessions from the Germans, we cannot always leave them empty-handed. The Germans have demanded that Romania stay in their influence because of the so-called 'close ties between us'. We know that this is code for the Germans to keep control over the Ploiești oil fields, yet it changes nothing. They have forced our hand, and now we must let go of our Romanian aspirations.\n\nMolotov has reported back, saying that whilst we may have lost Romania that is not reason enough to leave the conference, as this means the Germans will have to give somewhere else. He urges General Secretary Stalin not to cancel the talks, for we may still consolidate gains elsewhere. His points have a reason, so we shall not storm out of the talks when we are so close to wrapping up the agreement. Yet we still must have a firm hand, for we cannot allow the Germans to control everything."
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.12.A: "One more border for us to fortify..."

 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.13.t: "Southern Soviet Sphere"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.13.d: "As we push on through the conference, the Soviet Union has made one thing clear: The nations in the Middle East shall not be German puppets. Molotov has cemented the communist's position into the ground as we work our way through the matters being discussed. As our delegation has pointed out to Hitler, there is no real way we can rebuff these claims and order the Soviets to stand down, as we have no contacts or influence in these countries anyway.\n\nAs it stands now, we have to accept the Soviet demands on these territories, for better or worse. Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and all the other states will have to bow to their new Soviet overlords. If we please them enough with this concession, perhaps we may gain more in the long term than the dastardly communists will."
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.13.A: "A small price to pay for salvation."

 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.14.t: "Germany confirms our claims to the South"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.14.d: "The Germans have offered us an opportunity. An opportunity to assert ourselves on the world stage. At the conference, the Germans mentioned the states to our south: Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, and such. They hinted at the fact that the Soviet Union could easily influence and assert themselves over these weak nations, and secure Soviet dominance in the region. This not-so-subtle mention that the Southern States are private property waiting to be redistributed by us is an extremely helpful one, as it ensures that the Germans won't question our stranglehold on the region if we choose to exert ourselves.\n\nThis raises an opportunity, whether to accept the German offer and grow even more powerful as a nation, or decline and be seen as weak. There is only one option, and so we shall accept, for the benefit and glory of the Soviet Union."
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.14.A: "We shall not waste this newfound opportunity..."

 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.15.t: "The Final Draft"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.15.d: "And so the time has come. The deals have been made, the treaties have been formulated, and the conference has ended. Molotov walked down the hallway, flanked by the German Ambassador and another diplomat. They turned into a hallway and walked to the door enshrined at the end of the corridor.\n\nHe entered through the doorway and was faced with a man he was told to despise. He was a counterrevolutionary enemy. He was THE enemy. He had spent years campaigning against the eradication of his nation with violence and hateful speeches. Yet he seemed..... calm, quiet. Almost as if he was.... pleased? Molotov stopped. The man offered his hand. He took it, after some trepidation.\n\nThe treaty was laid out. Lines upon lines of print. All of it meant nothing alone. However, once it was all united? A new dawn for his nation, and for the world indeed. The man opposite him looked upon the rows and rows of paper. He took out a pen and put his signature on the dotted line.\n\nThen the charters were given to him. The man who has been crowned by Stalin as his nation's greatest threat offered his pen. He smiled, took it, and signed his name. He put down the pen and grinned. He had just signed a piece of paper. A piece of paper that would change millions of people's lives. A camera flashed. There was no turning back now."
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.15.A: "And so the Bear deals with the Eagle"

 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.16.t: "A Moscow-Berlin Axis Announced!"
 GER_Berlin_Moscow_Pact.16.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]After a long period of intense and secretive negotiations, the German and Soviet governments have made a joint statement today concerning the purpose behind the meetings, a deal that splits parts of the world into German and Soviet spheres of influence, effectively putting both the German Reich and the Soviet Union on the same side of any future conflicts.\n\n“By reaching past our ideological differences and signing this pact, we can ensure the end of the Western democracies’ hegemony over the world and usher in a great new era, free from the shackles of capitalism and international finance,” announced Adolf Hitler.\n\nThis announcement will surely be a surprise for the major democracies around the world, as even though relations between Berlin and Moscow have been warming recently, a deal with the scale of this one would have been thought to be impossible to agree upon unless major concessions were made on both sides.\n\nNevertheless, they will now have to react strongly, less they project an image of weakness, which won’t inspire confidence in a world that is beginning to descend into chaos."

The Soviet government has continued its old two-faced Bolshevist policy. Bolshevist activity in Europe already cannot leave a doubt about Soviet intentions. The Soviet Union declared in Moscow to the German foreign minister that they did not intend to interfere with German interests.

The Communist scum manipulates their puppets around the globe through lies, but under the guidance of our glorious Führer, the German people have seen through this fake dream of World Revolution they brag about. Preparations have been made by our military high command for a surprise strike against the Soviet Union. Operation Barbarossa is an ambitious plan that involves taking advantage of the pre-emptive attack, sweeping through the Baltics, Byelorussia, and Ukraine. Using Blitzkrieg tactics, our Panzer divisions will race ahead, encircling swathes of Soviet divisions and leaving the infantry to mop them up. It is ironic that our predecessor, the Kaiserreich, created this communist beast by sending Lenin to Russia, and now we are tasked with its destruction. Fate is simplistically beautiful. This upcoming battle will either be our salvation or our death. No expenses can be made. The hordes of zombies brainwashed by Soviet propaganda will be purged ruthlessly by the bullet.\n\nHowever, some voices have echoed within our officer corps that the invasion would be best off at a later point when we can further build our army to match the number of men the Soviets field.

 GER_Naval_Agreement.1.d: "When the Great War came to a close, it was the will of the British people to punish Germany for her crimes against peace, so our diplomats shackled her with military restrictions and reparations to ensure the German eagle could never threaten us again. However, in recent years, public opinion has moved quite drastically in the other direction- due in no small part to the criticisms of economist John Maynard Keynes.\n\nWhen Germany's mass printing of currency to pay reparations caused the hyperinflation crisis in the '20s, the British people felt a sort of responsibility for the suffering of the Germans, and calls for leniency grew louder.\n\nAt the Foreign Office, an internal memo suggests that we begin to loosen military restrictions on Germany, and \"Eliminate those parts of the Peace Settlement which, as practical people, we knew to be unstable and indefensible.\" Fortunately for us, we have an opportunity to do just that- the German Führer, Adolf Hitler, has suggested in a recent speech that he would be willing to negotiate a naval rearmament treaty between our two countries.

The British finally accepted Hitler's proposal of a 100:35 ratio, meaning the Kriegsmarine will be allowed to rearm and rebuild up to 35% of the Royal Navy's tonnage. Many in the foreign service believed the British would never agree to the ratio, and von Ribbentrop's unexpected success has won him great favor in Berlin's halls of power and with the Führer himself.\n\nThe announcement of this treaty has enraged the French, who claim that Britain has no right to release Germany from the terms of the Versailles Treaty.

Joachim von Ribbentrop and the head of the British delegation, Sir John Simon, signed a treaty that allows Germany to pursue limited naval rearmament while conceding naval dominance to the British.\n\nThe Führer, recognizing the \"necessity of naval dominance for the island nation\" has agreed to limit the size of the Kriegsmarine to 35% of the Royal Navy's tonnage, allowing Germany to create a force equal to the French Marine Nationale.\n\nThe treaty's announcement met with outrage from the French, who claim that the United Kingdom has no legal right to release Germany from the treaty's restrictions."

The first is that it has only been a couple of years since the Anti-Comintern Pact was signed between Germany and other fascist nations of the world, a clear threat against our nation. The second problem is that some within the Congress of Soviets are concerned that making a pact with the fascists is a foolish move and that Hitler cannot be trusted.\n\nDespite all of this, however, a treaty to ensure that there will be no conflict between us could play to our strengths, as it will allow us to focus our forces in other areas and build our strength to preserve the ideas of our glorious union."

One might be because of our ideological differences, and therefore they see us as a threat to Communism. Another reason may be because they have also been talking with Britain and France about “collective security”, in an attempt to contain our nation that they see as a “threat”.\n\nWhile this is a disappointing result, we will not let it stop our pursuit of uniting the Germanic people, and we will find a way to do so, with or without those greedy Bolsheviks!

In particular they look to the territory of Danzig, which separates Ostpreussen from the rest of their nation.\n\nNow, they have demanded that Danzig be ceded to [GER.GetNameDef], and in exchange offer nothing but a promise to waive their claims on Poznan. With the threat of war looming, accepting the offer will delay a possible conflict, but at the cost of freely granting the Germans more strength for whatever lies ahead."

However, with the current illegitimate English government, there is no chance of starting peace talks. If we are to win this war and establish our dominance in Europe, we must first reorganise the British government, and we have just the man for the job.\n\nEdward VIII, former King of the United Kingdom, is currently appointed Governor of the Bahamas, after accusations of being a Nazi sympathiser. Edward and his wife sympathised with fascism and our government before and during the war, touring Germany shortly after their marriage where they had tea and a long conversation with Adolf Hitler. Edward has even asked the Wehrmacht for protection during the occupation of France. Therefore we have made sure to keep a close eye on him so that we may be able to use him once the time is right.\n\nWith Operation Sealion being a success, there is no better time to restore the rightful ruler of England back to the throne."

Edward VIII, who had abdicated years before to marry American starlet and divorcee Wallis Simpson, had arrived on the isles only days before to reclaim the throne.\n\nEdward VIII was crowned for the first time in Westminster Abbey's regal and immaculate halls, but the scene is very different this time. The abbey has already been severely damaged by German artillery and firebombing, and the roof must be quickly rebuilt for the ceremony. The abbey's front is adorned with the swastika of the German Reich rather than the Union Jack.\n\nThe Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, was in attendance and was heavily escorted by his bodyguards. Observers believe that the re-coronation of the king is a political move by Hitler to end fighting and resistance on the British Isles, as King George VI has fled to Canada and condemned the action, calling it "nothing more than a puppet king with his strings clenched tight."\n\nExperts believe that the British populace who have remained on the island will rally to Edward VIII, who had much popular support during his short reign, as they feel abandoned by the king and his government.

Instead, the selected king Edward the VIII will represent Britain itself. France has already been dealt with, so now it’s time to finally dictate peace.\n\nHitler was excited at the prospect of a German Europe, but peace had to be made first to give the German Volk a breath of fresh air. But where would a good place be? Where would be a place where Germany would regain its prestige and power by crushing the British and French in revenge? Hitler knew exactly the place where the negotiations would take place, and now he had to make it clear to his cabinet.\n\n“To undo the humiliating peace upon us in the First World War”, Hitler stated to his surrounding cabinet, “We must enact revenge and redemption. By holding these said negotiations in The Hall of Mirrors in Versailles.”\n\nTo Hitler, the palace in which Germany was shamed and defeated shall be overshadowed by this new victory Germany would obtain.

As a result, the German Reich decided to establish an Axis-aligned regime in England, with Lord Halifax as the new Prime Minister and Edward VIII as the proclaimed king.\n\nGermany has now dictated terms to the defeated powers, and delegates from all over Europe have signed the Third Treaty of Versailles.

Dissenting preachers will either be pulled on our side, being made to see the superiority of the hooked cross, via bribery, or simply will fall victim to unfortunate accidents.

While such units raised from superfluous personnel of the Kriegsmarine would greatly be lacking in many fields, but compared to other alternatives, they would at the very least have the bare weapons training beforehand. In addition, there is a significant amount of heavy weaponry with the Navy lying around, and would allow for the formation of Heavy Infantry, i.e. “Volksgrenadier” formations, that undoubtedly would give them a combat edge against our enemies as well as in comparison to other last-minute formations being raised by us."

However the fact remains, for whatever reason- maybe our enemies' have gained a technological edge, or we've simply lost all our combat effective pilots, the Luftwaffe's ability to effectively wage an aerial war has been completely eroded. The ground troops being as desperate as they are, our Air forces have become equally so, and desperate times call for equally desperate measures.\n\nIn that view, our pilots will now be asked to go beyond nominal operation protocols.

With the support of Hermann Göring, the project shall help relieve our citizens and soldiers alike of the bombings.\n\n However, our new planes, while effective they are too expensive to make. So an idea was brought up to make cost-effective planes that would have to be fast to make. This Emergency Fighter Program has to switch its focus to defensive fighters.

Furthermore, our casualty counts are staggering, to say the least, and the Soviets appear to have endless hordes at their disposal. How much longer can our Deutschland sustain this fight?\n\nThere is an option in our arsenals that we have not employed. One that still terrifies the hardest of generals and the toughest of soldiers. It chokes the strongest lungs, kills the smallest creature and blots out the sun. Germany still has its chemical weapons. Mustard Gas, Tabun and Sarin fill the shelves of these accursed stockpiles. A deadly cocktail only reminding us of the unbelievable horrors of the Great War. While some younger officers have considered the usage of these devices, the older men dare not speak of it.\n\nEven our Führer himself has refused to use them, himself being a victim of gas at Ypres. He has expressly forbidden gas to even be transported to the East, in fear of a rogue commandant gassing Soviet soldiers, leading to retaliation and retribution. The Allies themselves have enormous reserves of gas. If we make this choice, millions more will die. They could gas entire divisions, armies, or even our heartlands.

Creating the largest Panzer IV factory in the Reich has paid off, and whilst our Panzertruppen has been well supplied with the vehicles produced at the Nibelungenwerk, the attrition on the battlefield grows worse and worse. The only way to mediate this development is to expand on the Nibelungenwerk, to allow the production of the armored vehicles there to grow exponentially beyond what can be achieved at its current level. As we currently produce Panzer IVs as well as manufacturing wheels for Krupp-Gruson Werke, another expansion could potentially allow us to start assembly of the new Tiger tanks created by Krupp. Increasing the size of the Nibelungenwerk is a necessary step in the right direction for our armored force, and for the Wehrmacht as a whole."

However, due to the sheer size of the organization, it has become inefficient. This inefficiency, combined with poor resource allocation and the low prices at which war materials have been sold, has resulted in the organization operating at a loss.\n\nTo remedy the situation, the Reichswerke must be streamlined, and a massive restructuring of its composition must be undertaken. The most important part of this process will be the organization of the various assets into three blocks. Block A will consist of the assets related to coal, iron, and steel, Block B will be made up of weapons and munitions related holdings, while Block C will comprise of river and rail transportation resources.

One of which is a trade embargo similar to the one from the Weltkrieg, wherein the Allies have blockaded our trade with Sweden for tungsten, by pressuring the Nordic governments to follow their demands or face war. Such maneuvers have starved our war machine, and has already taken effect in our war efforts in the Benelux. As such, we shall initiate Unternehmen Weserübung, the invasion of Scandinavian Europe, to ensure our interests in the region are fully met and secured."

 GER_Invasion_of_The_Lowlands_desc: "France, as weak as they are, have managed to hold our advances, thanks to the Maginot Line, a series of fortifications across our borders that have left our advances in a stalemate. However, the French have one weakness, something that they didn’t learn from the Weltkrieg. According to our military strategists, the Benelux region is not only lightly defended, but also its borders are lightly defended by the French, allowing us to easily move around such defensive arrays and end the stalemate that will lose our war. Sure, the French may have tricks up their sleeve, but we all know that the politicians of Paris are too prideful of their victory that they don’t see death on the horizon."

Following our failure at diplomatically forcing Austria into our fold, the only choice we have left is a military intervention, which will definitely be an important test for our armed forces.\n\nThe main force of Wehrmacht will attack from Bavaria, with our fast and trained mountaineer units being quick enough to threaten Vienna and force the Austrian government to surrender. Although a highly mountainous region, the OKW does not expect Austrian Bundesheer to put up much of a fight - with our quick thrust, we should be able to force Vienna to bow down before their government can even mobilize the military properly.\n\nThe scale of our success will depend on two equally-important factors - the tenacity of our mountaineer units to cross the Alps with relative ease, as well as the speed of the rest of the Wehrmacht. Large-scale propaganda efforts, calling for Austrians to surrender will also ensure we reach Vienna with minimal casualties."

Created in a mild panic by the OKH as a response to the British Plan R 4 to invade Norway and prevent iron exports from Sweden reaching Germany, the speed and efficiency of this attack is of utmost importance.\n\nThe first part of the plan involves Denmark - Weserübung Süd. This part of the plan is crucial for guaranteeing German supremacy in the Baltic Sea, preventing Allied incursions and operations. The plan of attack is a combined assault on Denmark to overrun the country as swiftly as possible. It includes an airborne assault on the Aalborg airfields, a surprise landing of infantry from naval auxiliaries at Copenhagen, and a simultaneous ground assault across the Jutland peninsula.\n\n§YOKW does not see Denmark as much of a threat and reports the following with the utmost confidence - "We'll take it in a day!"§!"

This stage of the operation requires a full army corps including a mountain division, an airborne division, a motorized rifle brigade, and two infantry divisions, along with a large Kriegsmarine taskforce. The target objectives of the force are the Norwegian capital Oslo and nearby population centers like Bergen, Narvik, and Trondheim. The plan also calls for the swift capture of the king of Norway to trigger a rapid surrender. There have been difficulties in getting the different branches of OKW to coordinate on this operation - only our Führer has been able to cease the constant butting of heads between them.\n\n§YDespite initial disagreements, OKW reports that our forces are more than up to the task.

Following this maneuver, our forces will swing South and destroy the rest of the Belgian army, while also starting the preparations for the attack on France. As a safety measure the Führer has also approved the threat of terror-bombings should the governments of the Netherlands and Belgium try to delay the capitulation of their forces.\n\nThe OKW is extremely optimistic that the Wehrmacht will be able to reach all strategic objectives, within a reasonable timescale and with minimal casualties."

 GER_Fall_Rot_desc: "Fall §YRot§!, or Case Red, is our current plan for the invasion of France, drafted by the OKW as the followup to Fall Gelb, the invasion of the Benelux.\n\nThe Plan calls for an encirclement of the Allied Forces in Belgium and Northern France, at the channel coast where they then will be destroyed by our regular units. This encirclement will be achieved through a massive attack in the Ardennes spearheaded by our armored divisions. After the destruction of the Allied Forces in Belgium and Northern France we will then use the momentum of our forces to swing South and overwhelm the remaining defenders, while also occupying key cities such as Paris. Simultaneously, some of our Force will turn eastwards and encircle the French Forces on the Maginot line, preventing them from a counter-attack. Once this encirclement has been achieved, we will begin to cautiously attack the Maginot Line, destroying the encircled forces, which should force the French Army to surrender once and for all.\n\nSome generals in the OKW are worried about the vulnerability of our Spearhead and the potential casualties in the attack on the Maginot Line, but most generals are confident in our victory."

 GER_Fall_Grun_2_desc: "Fall §YGrün§!, or Case Green, is the proposed plan of Invasion of Ireland. A secluded isle approximately 20 kilometers from the isle of Great Britain, a naval invasion of Ireland will be difficult, if not outright harder than invading the United Kingdom, especially due to much poorer infrastructure and bigger distance between our naval bases in Northern France and Irish shores.\n\nThe OKW expects the main invasion force to come from the naval bases of one of our latest conquests, French ports in Calais. Supported by our fleet task forces, we will have no issues defending the troops on their way to reach the Irish shore. Following the successful invasion and establishment of a beachhead, the main regular units will be brought in, which will rush through the Irish countryside and make their way through to Dublin.\n\nPropaganda efforts will be another much-required asset in conquering Ireland. Our radio transmissions will broadcast messages painting us as \"saviours from the British dogs\" as well as support for giving the Irish government a piece of Ulster. What part of it becomes truth, however, that will be decided once Ireland is brought to its knees."

 GER_Unternehmen_Seelowe: "Unternehmen §YSeelöwe§!"
 GER_Unternehmen_Seelowe_desc: "Unternehmen §YSeelöwe§!, or Operation Sealion, is a massive military operation proposed by the OKW. In short, it calls for the naval invasion of the British Isles, something many would consider impossible, especially when comparing the size of Kriegsmarine to the one of the Royal Navy. Its success, however, will mark an important point for the Reich.\n\nThe operation will be largely dependent on full cooperation between the Heer, the Luftwaffe and the Kriegsmarine. Our main invasion force will start from the captured French naval bases, and travel all the way to the cliffs of Dover. The massive operation conducted by Luftwaffe will cripple the enemy’s response and mobilization of home guard forces, while the navy will ensure that our troops managed to cross the English Channel unscathed.\n\nThe OKW is worried about our ability to fully supply the invasion force, especially with British task forces still posing a significant threat. If we manage to threaten London, however, we will pass an important test for the Reich, as well as broadcast an important message to the world."

 GER_Unternehmen_Felix: "Unternehmen §YFelix§!"
 GER_Unternehmen_Felix_desc: "Unternehmen §YFelix§!, or Operation Felix, is the Wehrmacht's current plan for the seizure of the Rock of Gibraltar from the British. Hermann Göring has long advised the Führer to make a play for the region, and Felix has since gained significant traction at OKW, where it enjoys the outspoken support of General Heinz Guderian\n\nGibraltar is a formidable fortress, but no fortress is invulnerable. With the Caudillo's blessing, our troops will enter Spain over the Pyrenees, then travel south by rail to Gibraltar. Once they arrive, an assault with air and artillery support will take the Rock and cut the British Empire out of the Western Mediterranean. Abwehr Chief Wilhelm Canaris has repeatedly voiced considerable concerns about the viability of this operation, citing Spanish doubts and the lack of sufficient firepower- but despite this, the Rock may prove itself too tempting a target for the Führer to ignore.\n\nOKW is very confident in our troops' ability to break the pillars of Hercules, despite the Rock's daunting fortifications and the protests of the Abwehr."

 GER_Unternehmen_Isabella: "Unternehmen §YIsabella§!"
 GER_Unternehmen_Isabella_desc: "Unternehmen §YIsabella§!, or Operation Isabella, is the current Wehrmacht's plan to secure bases in Spain and Portugal after an eventual Soviet collapse or British landing in the region. The plan aims to occupy strategic positions on the Iberian Peninsula to conduct a more effective maritime estrangement of the British economy.\n\nSupported by a logistics base on Bordeaux, ground forces will cross the Pyrenees and establish bases across both countries. The Spaniards will likely be sympathetic to our cause, helping us to reject an Allied incursion. The alignment of the Portuguese, in this case, is unknown, so we shouldn't discard some resistance. The plan also includes the seizure of the Canary Islands, the Azores, the Cape Verde islands group, and the port of Dakar on French West Africa.\n\nThere are some concerns about the viability of the plan because of our current capabilities. However, if successfully implemented, it would give us a strategic position on the Atlantic to harass British convoys coming from India and the Middle East."

 GER_Unternehmen_Tannenbaum: "Unternehmen §YTannenbaum§!"
 GER_Unternehmen_Tannenbaum_desc: "Unternehmen §YTannenbaum§!, or Operation Tannenbaum, is the Wehrmacht's plan for the invasion of the mountain nation of Switzerland. Drafted by Captain Otto-Wilhelm Kurt von Menges from OKH, Tannenbaum relies on a feint to draw out and annihilate the Swiss army.\n\nThe best point for an invasion of Switzerland, the northwestern canton of Jura, still favors the defenders in every way, and a full assault would be insanity- but perhaps a feint into the Jura could draw out the Swiss militia forces, allowing our troops to encircle them. A massive air and artillery barrage would then reduce the enemy strength to a point where an attack is feasible. Should we succeed and Switzerland be conquered, that "wayward branch" of the German people will finally rejoin their brothers in the Thousand Year Reich. The non-German speaking areas could be granted to our allies or kept for repopulation by loyal German volk.\n\nOKW does not generally share the burning hatred the Führer holds for Switzerland and would prefer to leave the Alpine nation alone."

 GER_Unternehmen_Ikarus: "Unternehmen §YIkarus§!"
 GER_Unternehmen_Ikarus_desc: "Unternehmen §YIkarus§!, or Operation Icarus, is the Wehrmacht's plan for the invasion of Iceland. Daring to be sure, Ikarus calls for a frigid odyssey of over 1000 kilometers from the nearest safe port, a distance greater than the journey from Berlin to Paris.\n\nAfter our occupation of Denmark, Iceland hastily declared independence- quickly finding their declared neutrality violated by our enemy. Since its capture, the enemy has used the gloomy island as an outpost in the struggle for the Atlantic. We must liberate Iceland's cold shores, and deny her frozen harbors to the enemy. Transport ships or aircraft will spirit our troops across the sea during the long Arctic night, avoiding the enemy patrols until they arrive at their destination. Our troops will then take the island by storm and sea, conquering like the Vikings of old!\n\nOKW believes the voyage to be possible, given the element of surprise, but cannot guarantee that they will be able to resupply our force given the vast distances involved."

Initially, the focus was made to take the resource-rich areas of Ukraine and the Caucasus, but many in the OKW say the priority should be set towards a single target - that being Moscow, the logistical hub of the Soviet forces. Nevertheless, they have compromised on an all-out attack to capture all set objectives.\n\nAfter the set objectives are achieved, the Wehrmacht will continue to push on towards the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan Line, establish defensive positions along the Volga and wait out the inevitable collapse of the remaining Soviet forces.\n\n§YThe OKW says the following - “100 days and the Reds shall be crushed!”§!"

Should the Führer approve the plan, preparations for the following will begin immediately.\n\nArmy Group South will be divided into two forces, Army Group A (assigned to Operation Edelweiss) and Army Group B (assigned to Operation Fischreiher.) Edelweiss is the main southern thrust, crossing over the Caucasus to seize Baku. Operation Fischreiher will provide vital support for Edelweiss, taking up positions on the Volga river near Stalingrad and protecting Army Group A's flank.\n\nSeveral German oil firms have already been granted a 99-year lease to exploit the soon-to-be-taken oil reserves in service of the Fatherland, guaranteeing that our armies and industries will be fueled for the ginormous task that is laid ahead of us - finally bringing down the Soviet Menace.\n\nSome predictions state that without the oil of the Caucasus, the Soviet economy and armies, propped up only through gunpoint, may collapse on its own.\n\n§YSome at OKW would rather we focus our efforts on the capture of Moscow, but the value of the oilfields for our war effort is hard to understate.§!"

 GER_Unternehmen_Aida: "Unternehmen §YAïda§!"
 GER_Unternehmen_Aida_desc: "Unternehmen §YAïda§! is an operation designed to push the British forces from North Africa and achieve complete control over the Eastern portion of the Mediterranean. The plan aims to expel the British Army from Northern Egypt and reach El Cairo and the Suez Canal.\n\nThe command of the operation is under Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel, leader of the Panzerarmee Afrika. Our Italian allies will also be present with naval support and ground troops. Using the port of Tobruk to supply our forces and Libya's airfields for aerial support, our tanks will isolate the British infantry after annihilating the enemy's armoured divisions.\n\nThere are possible logistical constraints that could be present as we enter Egyptian territory. Speed is vital to avoid attrition and the arrival of fresh enemy divisions. But, if we are successful, we'll deal a significant blow to the United Kingdom, compromising their position in the Middle East and India."

 GER_Fall_Orient: "Fall §YOrient§!"
 GER_Fall_Orient_desc: "Fall §YOrient§!, or Operation Orient, is the operation designed to conquer the Levant, including Syria and Palestine. After our successful conquest of Egypt, we'll pursue the remaining British colonial armies that have consolidated new positions in the Middle East.\n\nWith control of the Egyptian ports and weaker British naval presence, our logistical situation we'll no longer be a problem. The Panzerarmee Afrika, working with Italian ground troops, will strike into Palestine from the Sinai, encircling the British Army against the Mediterranean coast and the Dead Sea. After occupying the ancient cities of Jerusalem, Damascus, and Bethlehem, we'll reach the Euphrates on the border with Iraq.\n\nAccording to OKW reports, we'll likely find support from the local Arab population, excited to expel the British and French oppressors of their rightful lands. Securing the Levant not only would allow us to take control of the Middle East's oil fields but also a future linking with our Japanese allies."

 GER_Fall_Achse: "Fall §YAchse§!"
 GER_Fall_Achse_desc: "Unternehmen §YAchse§!, or Operation Axis, is the current plan proposed by the OKW to bring our southern neighbours to their knees - the conquest of Italy, although possibly one of the most dangerous operations we might commence in Europe, will show that National Socialism and Fascism are not allies, and grant us direct access to the Mediterranean and the Balkans.\n\nThe most heated part of the war will most likely be breaching the Alps, mountains which the Italians used as their natural barrier for many, many years. Coordinated strike of the mountaineer units along with air support, however, should be able to push Mussolini’s forces away, and from there everything should go smoothly, as we can start to move south towards Rome. Psychological warfare should also help us in the conquest - by bombarding key cities using Luftwaffe, we can cripple Italian morale, reducing the amount of tenacity we should find within poorly-equipped, but nevertheless very ferocious Italian troops."

 GER_Unternehmen_Gertrude: "Unternehmen §YGertrud§!"
 GER_Unternehmen_Gertrude_desc: "Unternehmen §YGertrud§!, or Operation Gertrude, is the Wehrmacht's current plan for an invasion of TUR_Politics. OKW drafted Operation Gertrude in response to recent diplomatic developments, which have made the continued independence of Turkey unacceptable.\n\nOur force will cross the Bulgarian border and seize European Turkey, where it will divide in two. Group North will move to assault Istanbul from the West, while group South will dash across the Dardanelles and move North into the Çatalca Peninsula, where they will attack the ancient city from the East. With Istanbul under our control, our soldiers will be in position for a swift and decisive strike deep into the Turkish heartland, culminating in the capture of the enemy capital at Ankara.\n\nOKW has several concerns about the viability of Unternehmen Gertrud- some generals balk at the prospect of a prolonged campaign in the Turkish Highlands, or consider the crossing of the Dardanelles an unacceptable risk. However, should the Führer decide to pursue Gertrud, they will execute it to the best of their abilities."

 GER_Unternehmen_Merkur: "Unternehmen §YMerkur§!"
 GER_Unternehmen_Merkur_desc: "Unternehmen §YMerkur§!, or Operation Mercury, is the Wehrmacht's plan for the capture of the island of Crete. Mercury will target three strategic points on the north side of the island, the taking of which will allow reinforcement and resupply.\n\nMercury can take the form of an airborne operation, targeting the airfields at Maleme, Rethymno, and Heraklion, or a naval affair targeting ports at Souda, Rethymno, and Heraklion. Both present unique challenges- an airborne assault on this scale has never been attempted and could present unforeseen difficulties. On the other hand, a naval attack would have to run the risk of interception by the still-powerful enemy fleet.\n\nOKW is divided, with Kriegsmarine representatives strongly favoring a naval operation and the Luftwaffe pushing for an airborne solution. Representatives from the Heer are similarly divided, with some following the navy and others the air force."

The naval effort is mostly an Italian affair, consisting of a few marine and Blackshirt divisions with a Regia Marina escort- the Kriegsmarine has already licensed our latest landing craft design to the Italians for the operation.\n\nOKW is optimistic about Herkules, despite the usual doubts about Italian competence, and looks forward to removing the thorn that is Malta from their North African supply lines."

 GER_A_State_Within_a_State_desc: "Governance requires these three institutions in order to be effective - a vast bureaucracy in order to implement policies in a rapid yet widespread manner, an armed force capable of projecting power both abroad and at home, and administrators in order to govern territories far from the capital. These institutions are the foundations of government and power and are essential for, without them, a leader cannot do his job effectively.\n\nYet rarely do these institutions exist beyond national governments, much more in a political party. However, that is what the NSDAP is founded upon - a political party that mimics the same institutions that the Weimar Republic has.\n\nThe NSDAP has its own bureaucracy, one whose control rivals that of the Soviet Union, for it has its hands on many sectors. Economics, Foreign Affairs, Culture, Racial Policy - all are under the grasp of a man in brown with a swastika on his collars. The NSDAP has its own armed forces, one that can silence dissent with extreme prejudice. The NSDAP has its own administrators, ready to be deployed once the Führer's vision of Gleichschaltung has been manifested.\n\n§RThe State is the Party. The Party is the State.§!"

 GER_The_Weimar_Era_desc: "For all the flaws of the Weimar system, its ability to give rise to pseudo-dictators as it has, it still presents major restrictions for any potential strongmen attempting to take power.\n\nTo get emergency dictatorial powers, the 'strongman' must be in cahoots with the Reichspräsident. Not only this but to get emergency powers from Article 48, they must have the backing of a coalition in the Reichstag to prevent civil war and strife. Anyone who wishes to gain emergency powers must hope and pray for an incident that justifies them, and pray even harder that the separate factions of the Reichstag can come together and agree to grant them. The time that all of this takes might end a situation in which the powers could be used anyway, bringing the dictatorial figure back to square one.\nThe Weimar bureaucracy allows for any laws that are put through via emergency decree to be vetoed by the Reichstag. Other factions inside the Reichstag hold immense power to hinder any dictator. That is not to mention the limits provided by the federal system, with separate parliaments to control and democratic institutions to overcome - the obstacles to total power in Germany are uncountable.\nFor the strongmen eyeing the power of the Chancellor seat, these issues will be of immense concern.\n\n§RThe one thing holding Weimar democracy together is its own ineptitude.§!"

 GER_Limits_of_the_Weimar_Institutions_desc: "With the Enabling Act passed, some of the limits in the way of the Reichskanzler's path to total power have been curbed. He has received the emergency powers he needed, allowing him to surpass Reichstag's permission to curb civil liberties in the name of restoring order to our fractured nation. However, this is not the end of the process of removing the ghosts of the Weimar bureaucracy. Hitler now has to contend with the limits of the Weimar constitution that even his emergency powers are restricted by. While his powers include the suspension of civil liberties ad hoc, the constitution still binds these powers.\n\nThe largest obstacle in the path of further expansion of these powers is the everpresent Reichstag, with separate parties still having the right to exist - many of which oppose the current Reichskanzler and the NSDAP-led coalition. A step too far and the coalition could fall apart and the emergency powers may be torn from the Reichskanzler. The bureaucracy remains, and laws must still be passed through the Reichstag - most of which continue to be opposed by the SPD and it's communist agitator allies.\n\n§RIf Germany is to be restored to its former glory, we must find a way to bring down our opposing parties once and for all.§!"

 GER_Limits_of_the_Federal_System_desc: "The Reichskanzler stands ever-closer to bringing the German people to glory. The Communist threat in Germany brought about its own downfall, and we have finally ended the bureaucracy of the Reichstag - with all other parties disbanding, either voluntarily or forcefully. Now, only one system stands in our way of total control of German politics - the Federal system.\n\nThe Federal System consists of seven state parliaments (Landtag(single); Landtagen(plural)), all of which are able to contest laws passed down from the Reichstag - and when they do, valuable time is wasted reconvening the Reichstag to get a two-thirds vote to pass laws through. Separate votes must take place to force the law through different local parliaments - and this won't do. Valuable time and effort are wasted, and to destroy the remnants of the old and weak systems, the final part of the Weimar bureaucracy must be removed.\nWhen action is taken and the federal system is replaced with something more malleable to the German people's wishes, we can be sure that the German state will run as smoothly as possible.\n\n§YWhat is Germany known for if not efficiency?§!"

After the all the bumps and dents in the path to the agreement were smoothed over, the German and British nations finally came to an agreement, limiting the Kriegsmarine's tonnage to 35% of the Royal Navy - in doing so, giving us a silent blank cheque to unite the German peoples in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe British policy to naval agreements has drastically changed in the wake of their naval industry recession post-Wall Street Crash. Instead of building up their own fleet to maintain domination on the world stage, they have signed agreements with other nations to force limits on their navies. The London Naval Treaty is the first example of this, and now with the rearmament of the German nation scaling up to the British faster and faster, they are now attempting to put a limit on our inevitable rise.\n\nPerhaps, however - this agreement could lead to something more... pragmatic."

It calls for the territorial acquisition of our colonies and various territories in Europe, forces us to pay hefty war reparations, Disarm our Armed Forces, and accept all responsibility for the World War. Such treaty is absurd at best, while ludicrous at worst. It locks our nation away from the glory it was destined to have, and has brought the German people to their knees, swallowing bitter pills that are destroying our society from within.

Such collapse, however, didn’t stay only in American shores but affected all powers of Europe, including us. As their economy collapses, businesses are running tight ships, pulling out investments in foreign nations at a time of austerity, along with America’s futile efforts into stabilizing their economy through tariffs on foreign products such as ours. As a result, our economy has also collapsed, with businesses going bankrupt and our countrymen unemployed. A side effect is our government’s lack of response to this global crisis, which has strained our political capital and legitimacy. Forget all the other issues, this crisis is of top priority, one that needs grand solutions to resolve it."
