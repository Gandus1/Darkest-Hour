#Italy.1.t: "Fall of Fascist Italy"
#Italy.1.d: "Mussolini has been removed out of office by the Italian government, throwing Italy in turmoil. The defection of Rome presents us with a dilemma: we either fight on under German leadership, with only the north of Italy under our control, or we submit defeat and hope for lenient punishment from the western powers."

#Italy.5.d: "Those wretched Ethiopians, who so long ago brought shame to the Italian nation, have been struck down at last by the Iron Will of Fascism. The Ethiopians fought with spears and shields as the steel and lead of the Regio Esercito brought them to their knees. As the people of Addis Ababa looked on, great columns of trucks, tanks, and horses marched unopposed into their capital, truly demonstrating our superiority. The people of Italy celebrate the expansion of the Italian Empire, and our regime is solidified at home and abroad."

 ITA_Ethiopian_War.2.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Today Ethiopians, Italians, Eritreans and Somalians breathe a little easier as the representatives of the Duce and the Negus converged in order to preserve stability in the Horn of Africa via a joint non-aggression statement before the League of Nations. For much time Italy's ambitions in the region have been the origin of tensions over territory but it seems that the Duce is intent on extending an olive branch and put the past to rest.\n\nMembers of the assembly were pleased to see that the League's intention of keeping the peace among the member nations gave fruit to this development.\nSome however doubted the genuineness of such statement, labelling it a facade in order to buy time and that there will still be plenty of troops in the Italian Horn, but these voices went largely ignored as the headaches caused by such scepticism were much larger than accepting the fact that Italy was ready to, at least for now, curb the bad blood between the two nations.\n\nThe Duce, on the other hand, was seen with a rather satisfied visage in front of the response of the international community to his diplomatic move."

No doubt those British pissants have incited them to do it, they wouldn't have in them to do it without them.”\n\n“Bruno!” he shouted; a sunburnt, short Sicilian junior officer was rudely awoken from his daydream as he waited for the commander to read the reports prostrated before him, quickly reinforcing his "at the ready" stance.\n\n“Gather your men and start moving towards the Walwal fort post haste, I shall inform the others and contact command, this is unacceptable”\n\nThe officer did nothing but nod at his CO's barks and exited the room in a hurried manner with the commander trailing shortly before him."

 ITA_Ethiopian_War.6.d: "To Governor-General Maurizio Rava, RCSCT Command, Mogadiscio\nUrgent military communication, to be delivered immediately\n\nA week ago at the Ual-ual fort in which the local garrison of Dubats resided in was approached by a contingent of what we assumed then to be a rogue regiment of Abyssinians and were threatened to abandon the fort at once in the name of the Emperor of Abyssinia.\n\nThe garrison refused the threats and sent a direct correspondence to the nearby colonial troop contingent under the command of yours truly after which the Abyssinians retreated.\n\nIn the following days, our troops arrived at the location in order to investigate the matter and understand what had happened. However, during the investigative works the Somalis were once again approached by the Ethiopian contingent backed by Albionic advisors, we tried to reason with them and offer an agreement but their eternal greed blinded them and left off in a fury.\n\nFollowing the previous exchange, we knew that it was only a matter of time before we'd cross swords however we did not expect to be attacked undeclared. This morning a patrol of our brave Dubats was mowed down by Abyssinian machinegun fire, probably lent to them by the very same British we've encountered.\nResponse was swift and decisive, the Abyssinians were driven back with minimal casualties and extreme prejudice thanks to modern firepower. In the face of the presented situation, we must ask for a course of action.\n\n- Captain Roberto Cimmaruta, RCSTC"

A tacit accord perhaps?\n\n One thing is sure however, it will soon be seen if the League is made simply out of mere lip-service to a cause or it is backed by facts."

It appears that Italian Duce Benito Mussolini was not satisfied with the League of Nations decision to exonerate the African Nation of any wrongdoing following the WalWal Incident, choosing to invade the country instead.\n\nSo far the International Community has responded tepidly at best, with only the most minor of sanctions being placed upon the aggressor by the League of Nations. The Canadian delegate urged for some further response, however it seems no other nation has expressed this “Canadian Initiative” as the press have dubbed it. Even the twin powers of the United Kingdom and France have remained suspiciously silent on the matter - leaving Ethiopia to stand alone.\n\nInternational Observers predict that the isolated Ethiopia will not be able to resist the Italian invasion, with the poorly equipped and poorly trained Ethiopian Army no match for the modernized Regio Esercito."

The man, having been in the position since 1929 has done a competent job at keeping and expanding our armed forces, however, his views for the MVSN has been unacceptable. Ever since 1931 Gazzera's ambition has been to reintegrate the MVSN directly inside the Regio Esercito and effectively dissolve it, this has been met with fierce resistance from the National Fascist Party exponents. His opposition to these members and unwillingness to back down had prompted the Duce to step in and mend the situation, but to no avail, Gazzera wouldn't budge. \n\nAs such, his office has been removed from under his control and placed under the ever watching eye of Mussolini which will undoubtedly be the best for the cohesion of the armed forces and the future of our military endeavours. However, Gazzera remains a senator so his work with the party will continue even if in offices of diminished power."

 ITA_Colonial.1.t: "Appointing a Governor for Libya"
 ITA_Colonial.1.d: "Libya is by far and away, the most important foreign territory our nation currently controls. Not only does it give us a political instrument to showcase the Italian presence in Africa, but it is also strategically vital to the security of the empire. The Libyan territory gives us easy access to Britain and France’s North African territories, as we can easily strike out across the Nile take to choke Great Britain at the Suez if we go East or lock down the Mediterranean if we go West. Just as importantly, Libya is home to the only major source of domestic oil production in the Italian Empire.\n\nThus, one must understand the importance of ensuring good governance in the region. If the governor we choose to control the area fails in his duties, our oil could be threatened, and if the more rebellious elements of the area are not handled properly, the entire colony could be put at risk. \n\nTwo candidates have emerged for the position thus far. The first is Italo Balbo, former Marshal of the Air Force and former heir apparent to Benito Mussolini. A competent leader, who has recently fallen out of favor with the party, with the assignment to Libya being favored by many as a way to get him out of Italian politics in Rome.\n\nThe second contender is Rodolfo Graziani, the current Vice-Governor of Cyrenaica and commander of the Italian forces in Libya. He already has experience in handling the region, and his military skill and diligence could prove to be what’s necessary to crush Libyan resistance and finally complete the Italianization of Italian North Africa.\n\nWhom shall we choose to lead Libya into a glorious Italian future?"

Today, the Italian peoples have dared to do what that Romans did not dare, what they couldn't do or did not want to do. The coast of Libya has been lined with the mark of fascist modernity and progress. A great belt of asphalt now binds the before disjointed cities of Libya; once separated by great deserts these cities now stand connected in a way never before seen on the African continent, a symbol of the Italian ingenuity and will.\n\nAs of right now the great work stands at over 1800 km of asphalt, bringing together many costal oasi that were previously semi isolated, but of most relevance is the fact that the road connects the east and west of Libya, bringing a fully connected corridor all along the coastline; allowing for the improvement of local economies, the construction of new resorts, and most importantly the easy transport of military equipment in the defense or the 4th shore if the need ever arise.\n\nLike the Romans before us, we shall bring civilization to these lands long lost. But this only marks but the beginning of the great process to reclaim our birthright and il Duce will be the guiding light towards towards this goal."

After the shoot, he's expected to receive a wide celebration in Tripoli. Some could say all of this is for power, yes, but maybe for unity as well? The world is fractured at all corners, and any firm foundation uniting the people of Italy seems beneficial at this point, and-\n\n“Ugh!

 ITA_Colonial.4.d: "Can a sick man take care of others? \n\nAny sane man would say no, as it's custom to take care of the sick instead of working them more than before. Alas, that's what the Ottomans thought they could do. The broken Empire held onto the Libyan desert for more than 350 years, until we liberated them in the Tripolitanian War. Up until then, they never treated the Libyans as people. The old man of Europe coughed and wheezed - gasping for life until it was no more, it infected everything it touched. \n\nThat old man is long dead now, and we hold a small piece of its ashes. A piece of desert far, and wide - full of cultured and working people. The Libyans need a saviour to save them from the hardships left behind, and what better way to do that but treat them more equally than before? and give them the request they've earned. \n\nEstablishing new class citizenship to Libyans loyal to the fascist cause will reign in a new era for the oppressed Libyan people. More recruitment to the P.N.F and promoting religious equality are just a few examples included in the "new" Africa Orientale Italiana. Our ideology knows no bounds to our people…for the prosperity and for the development of our Empire."

 ITA_Colonial.5.d: "No one ever said colonization would be easy.

They all have the same common theme: A lack of a sense of unity. The Great Powers of old thought they could just walk in and strip whatever they could, without a hint of compensation for the people there. Sure, we may have had to… “forcefully” take what was ours, but we don't consider those supportive of our colonial cause lesser than us.\n\nThe Africa Orientale Italiana, or AOI, addresses that lack. The plan consists of merging the pre-existing colonies of Italian Somaliland and Italian Eritrea with the newly conquered Ethiopian state. Although it could be an initial bureaucratic nightmare, establishing our presence and creating a national identity of Italian Africa could be worth it. Assigning a governor to the region would also help with the logistical assistance, dividing them into six separate Governorates. \n\nEl Duce pondered this and sat back in his chair. It seems all in order. It all comes down to how the citizens of our colonies will respond to the new organization. "

What happens if we get involved in a higher conflict, would I be able to stop it, when he refused all advice, even on this puny war?” The monarch sat down in his chair and rubbed his head in anger and hopelessness. “It seems I'm becoming a jewelled figurehead Mussolini can throw around for fun.”\n\nThe advisor scanned the paper, searching for a solution when a curious thought entered his head. “Sir, ask the Duce to proclaim yourself the new Emperor of Ethiopia.” The King's eyes widened as he thought about the idea. “Haile Selassie is currently in exile, so you could claim the empty title all on your own. This way, Benito will be forced to give you some peace of the victory in Africa, and you can still hold some influence in the government using that.”\n\nEmmanuel sat up as if he thought such a proposal could work, then the look faded, and he sat back in his chair. “The Ethiopian reaction could easily be vitriolic, they would never accept anyone except an Ethiopian on the throne.

 ITA_Economic_Tree.3.d: "A new agreement between us and the Germans was struck today.\nAlbert Speer chose to contact us after noticing his lack of influence within Hitler's inner circle. As an ambitious architect, Speer attempted to centralise German industry, but with war looming, it became more difficult to find good men to run the Reich's military and civilian sectors.\n\nThe remedy for this is straightforward: young, hardworking men. Italy and Germany, as ideological partners, should collaborate on a variety of levels. For example, information in exchange for people sent to Bavaria and Rhineland, to expand the industry sector.\n\nBenito Mussolini, upon accepting this proposal, requested one thing in return: German military advisors. Speer and his delegates accepted the terms without hesitation and quickly left for Rome. Except for Speer, who was seduced by Italian architecture and visited Naples and Florence.\n\nAfter a few weeks of planning, thousands of volunteer workers, accompanied by the Army, crossed the border in Tyrol, meeting German advisors along the route. The Duce, pleased to see Italian-German relations improving, has pronounced himself pleased with the sequence of events."

Mussolini was invited a few days ago by the site manager, who gave him a symbolic key to the new city!\n\nThe new city, dubbed "Sabaudia," is the crowning achievement of the Ponti region. Without the swamps and diseases, cultures have begun to grow normally, and the construction of new buildings is also accelerating.\n\nA few cities have begun construction throughout the region, but only Sabaudia has progressed quickly enough to be ready for our Duce's visit. During his visit, Mussolini was impressed by the quality of the construction, despite the short time frame, but he also enjoyed the garden, which had been specially prepared for him. Seeing the beauty of the flowers in what was previously only a "disease hole," the Duce invoked the Italian spirit, who can create beauty in any land if he works hard enough.\n\nFinally, after a ceremonial dinner with his son-in-law, Galeazzo Ciano, and the newly appointed mayor, Mussolini resumed his tour of the few other cities under construction in the region, hoping to meet with the workers, the "fierce people of Italy.""

For months, the Duce has been submitting his project to the Great Council of Fascism, which has one clear goal: draining the country's swamps.\n\nFor centuries, the aforementioned swamps have been the source of disease transmission. The Duce then ordered the cleaning and total restructure of the Agro Pontino, the most touched area, in response to what he called a "logical problem."\n\nMussolini's second project, once the draining is completed, would be to build cities in new regions and, perhaps, revolutionise architecture for Italy once more!\n\nHowever, cleaning up the area will take years for the time being. Despite the thousands of workers who come here every day, diseases like malaria continue to spread, and the resources required to complete the project are massive, especially for a country with our economy.... Despite the numerous minor issues that have arisen, the work continues, slowly but steadily. Maybe someone will live here one day?"

As such, it would be logical to join arms and honour their alliance. We might be incapable of defending ourselves alone after all the devastation and their help could come in handy. We share several similarities; we are both catholic nations, we are both of Latin origin, and we are similar ideologically aligned. Furthermore, the Italians might share the fruits of their conquests with us.\n\nYet some in our cabinet recommend that we refuse their offer. Joining an alliance with Italy would tie our foreign policy to them and potentially alienate ourselves from other powers, or even drag us to an unnecessary war. Some of our generals also worry about the Italians' competence, stating that “we won't follow those megalomaniac fools into their doom.”"

This is the most straightforward solution at hand, the nationalists got their victory and we get our money back. Yet after the devastation the Civil War caused, the Spanish may need every single peseta to rebuild their once-great nation.\n\nOur foreign minister suggests that we overlook some of their debt. At first, this may not sound like the most brilliant idea, but it would undoubtedly bring the Spaniards closer to us. Gaining a new ally would repay our efforts tenfold. Besides, what is just a few million Liras to the great Italian economy?\n\nWe are left with to choose between demanding all of our money back, or asking for only some of it and gaining the Spanish as our comrades."

It aims to reaffirm the Locarno Treaties and to declare that the independence of Austria "would continue to inspire their common policy". The signatories also agreed to resist any future attempt by Germany to change the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nThe Stresa Front, as the agreement is also referred to, was triggered by Germany's declaration of its intention of building up an air force, increasing the size of its army and introducing conscription. All of these actions are direct violations of the Treaty of Versailles, which limits the size of the German army to 100,000 men and prohibits Germany from using conscription and having an air force.\n\nSince British politicians stated they do not want to attack or occupy Germany, but prefer to have agreements with it to maintain peace in Central Europe and with antiwar sentiment being very strong among the British public, they thought this to be the best way to contain Germany.\n\nHowever, already some people are doubtful and think that these countries will not follow up on this agreement if push comes to shove."

Furthermore, this could prove a great blow to the popularity of our government, with the majority of the population firmly being on Ethiopia's side.\n\nHowever should we refuse the Italian request, it remains a possibility that Italy leaves the Stresa Front completely, with their trust in us destroyed, driving the Italians directly into Germanys' arms.\nThis decision could very well decide the odds of the wars to come."

As it stands, we have three options worth pursuing,\n\nThe first and most comfortable choice for our British friends would be the Atlantic, where a significant part of their fleet already patrols. Although our navy is not accustomed to the vast ocean, that in and on itself might be a reason for pursuing this path. Battleships, along with carriers, roam the vast water body. While we don’t possess carriers or that many battleships, perhaps there is wisdom to be found in the ‘Pax Britannica’, an age where behemoths assured a century of relative global peace.\n\nThe second option would obviously be Mare Nostrum, the Mediterranean. Home to our entire fleet and a sizable British squadron, naval exercises here would best suit our own needs, for the Italian Navy is built around a war in the almost enclosed sea. Our insular friends wouldn’t have any real reason to complain if we propose this location, if only because they would marginally benefit from it.\n\nThe third, and most controversial choice would be the North Sea. Regia Marina has never ventured into the chilly waters of Northern Europe, as such, it would be somewhat of a logistical challenge to even get a squadron there. However, some of our admirals think that the Navy would gain invaluable experience in one area: submarine warfare. While we ourselves possess quite a few of these lethal submersibles, it could be argued we have not used them to their full potential.

 ITA_Pact_with_Albion.8.d: "The Italian firm ‘Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino’, better known as Fiat, has proposed joint development of an aircraft! Planned to be designed and built together with Supermarine, a respected and well-known British aircraft manufacturer, the supposed warplane would be the pinnacle of air engineering, combining the elements of each firm to produce a flying machine of death.\n\nGiven the recent ‘British-Italian friendship’, such a development would be, for all intents and purposes, a beneficial endeavor for multiple reasons. For one, the aforementioned friendship would no doubt deepen, with the side effect of obtaining a potentially superior aircraft.\n\nThe downside is the disparity in technology. It is widely known that the Italian warplanes are… lacking in some areas. The only thing going for them is the manoeuvrability of the latest Fiat aircraft, the CR.42 Falco, its speed, armament, and armour being outdated. Many say that such a collaboration would result in more gain for our olive-skinned Mediterranean friends, and we ought to receive compensation for that unfairness. \n\nAnd there is always the option of refusing them outright. Aircrafts have proven to be vital for the war effort, any advantage in air equating to a decisive advantage on the ground. No one would disagree when we say that willingly giving up what amounts to strategic advantages in the form of this "Eurofighter" is rather foolish, especially in light of the possibility of conflict."

Whatever the reason may be, Britain reacted to our offer by asking for payment, stating that since theirs is the more superior aircraft manufacturing, imparting that knowledge requires compensation.\n\nSuch plain greed does not go unnoticed, and we begin to wonder if the project is worth the money requested. On one hand, the potential aircraft could prove to be a game-changer, not only for our military but for the air manufacturing complex as a whole. Obtaining the knowledge of the Brits has the potential to propel our technology by many years, so much so that we can even talk of an independent and powerful air force, independent of external players. Of course, such a future would be quite far away. But the possibility is there.\n\nOn the other hand, the cost might not be worth it. We already have other issues to deal with, many of them in other branches of the military, and those funds that would be used for the joint development might make a difference in other parts of the state apparatus."

And on the desk in front of the painting, is an old copy of the Treaty of London from when it was signed in 1915. It is not so much a treaty more than it is a scruffy piece of parchment with wrinkled, dried out and broken promises, promises that brought us into the war on the side of the Triple Entente. Even the name of the alliance never represented the brave sacrifices our men made on the frigid slopes of the Alps, as the name was originally there to include Russia, France, and Britain.\n\nBut now, the day has finally arrived where we will request the lands that have been unrightly denied from us for so long, Dalmatia just to name one part, a part which now helps to form the abominal nation of Yugoslavia. On that fateful day in 1918, the day we were told that the treaty was a “secret pact”, and therefore our claims would not stand in any of the main treaties signed, we knew that we had been stabbed in the back. We Italians refer to our victory in the Great War as a “ Vittoria Mutilata” or “mutilated victory”, as we gave so much and gained so little. However, the creation of the Stresa Front with Britain and France presents an opportunity to regain our rightful land through diplomatic means. \n\nWhile we hope that they will back our request to force Yugoslavia to hand over our land peacefully, there are two problems that appear. One is that we differ ideologically from France and Britain, and so they may feel that we are being too ambitious and too threatening. The second problem is that we have no idea if we can trust them again. \n\nAfter all, it is hard to teach an old dog new tricks."

The lengthy message stated that as part of the Treaty of London we signed in 1915 - a treaty that has since been declared null and void - all lands promised must be given to the Kingdom of Italy. This is largely to do with the Adriatic Coast and Dalmatia, which helps to form part of Yugoslavia. While it was agreed in 1915 that in return for entering the war on our side, Italy would be given that and other pieces of land, the treaty was secret, and when it came to splitting up the Austro-Hungarian Empire, it was not taken into consideration. The Italians see this as a great betrayal, while we see it as a fair deal, as they did receive considerable concessions, those being South Tyrol and Trieste. \n\nAs we, France, were a signatory of the treaty, as well as the current Stresa Front, Italy has come to us to back their claims and force Yugoslavia’s hand. We now have two options: we either side with Italy, changing the borders but strengthening the Stresa Front, or we can refuse their demands at the cost of weakening the pact we have created with them and Britain.\n\nWhatever the response may be, the Italians want an answer soon, but we must be careful not to rush such a delicate matter."

This was part of some of the promises we made in 1915 when we signed the Treaty of London, although, in the aftermath of the Great War, these promises were declared invalid, leaving Italy with only a few of the lands promised. This in turn caused Italian backlash against us and Britain, as we had supposedly stabbed them in the back.\n\nThe Italians have taken the opportunity of being in the Stresa Front with us to try and get our backing to support their claims, most of these falling on lands currently owned by Yugoslavia. While we are under no obligation to help the Italians out, it might prove to be a good decision if we want to ensure the survival of the Front. However, supporting them might cause a backlash in the international community, especially from Yugoslavia.

While this is not ideal, we can see where their governments are coming from, as they want to avoid any international backlash if they agree with us. However, we Italians are not known for giving in so easily, and, to benefit our larger interests, we'll likely push on with the demands we have laid out as they are.

Britain and France both sent similar messages, speaking of how “the Adriatic Coast and other parts of the Yugoslavian nation belonged to Italy”  and that we should “come to the negotiating table to find a solution peacefully.” It was a much nicer message than the one we received from the Italian government.\n\nTheir message in no other terms stated that we were holding Italian land hostage under our “corrupt and evil regime” and that they “would not tolerate the occupation any further.” The lands they speak of have never been Italian, although their government must be blinded by the fact they missed out on them after the end of the Great War.\n\nThe Italians now want a firm yes or no answer on whether we are to hand over our territory to them. We have no obligation to do so, and the British and French seem a little cautious in their backing of the Italians. However, there is the possibility of the situation escalating further, and should the Italians want to use their army to take the land from us, we would be in a much weaker position, as our forces are not up to the same standard as them.\n\nThe time has come to give them a response, and we say…"

This might anger those who have been waiting for the return of our lands, but it will please Britain and France, as they will think we have backed down. Only for now though, as eventually, they will see that they cannot deny what they promised us in 1915.\n\nThe other option is to use our proud army to forcefully seize the land and free those who have been oppressed by the crooked Yugoslavian regime. This will upset the French and British very much, not to mention Yugoslavia of course, but there comes a point when we can no longer listen to them and be held back. If neither of them is willing to support an old ally, we must forge our own path and send our forces to crush Yugoslavia ourselves.

At face value, cooperation in this field can only help us.\n\nUnfortunately, beneath the surface lie some cracks. Motivation and capital are important factors, but one cannot look only at these factors to determine the competence of an armed force. As it stands, the ‘Regio Esercito Italiano’ has shown itself to be a place of high morale and relatively well-trained personnel, but some questionable leadership in the form of its officers. The last thing we desire is for incompetence to be transmitted to our own cadre.\n\nAs it stands, the Italians have more to gain from this than we do.

A meeting representing the ‘115 million’ Germans and Italians against the Western powers and Bolshevism. Of course, such a meeting would have its share of political aims. For us, it would represent our giving the Italians an opening towards further diplomacy between our two nations, maybe even giving way to more formalized ties between our two nations that might gain us both benefits.\n\nFor example, Austria’s independence has been guaranteed by Italy for quite some time. While our nation is in no position to fight a war, it might benefit far more to simply align ourselves with Italy and bring them into the fold, having them forgo such a guarantee voluntarily. After all, Italy’s ambitions are many, and their allies few. This is why they are so keen on having Mussolini visit. Opening relations with us would give them a greater diplomatic weight to throw around Europe and allow them to pursue their goals more easily.\n\nThat said, there are those in government who find the idea of an alliance with Italy distasteful. The Italian military isn’t exactly renowned for its prowess, and its struggles in capturing the African territories of Libya and Abyssinia since the turn of the century have not done much to assuage fears on their incompetence.

If the Germans refuse cooperation with us now, they will surely come crawling back once they realize the magnitude of opposition they face on all sides. Not to mention, we maintain a guarantee of independence for Austria. That agreement will give us some leverage against Germany should they choose to pursue their goal of uniting all Germanic peoples as their leader has droned on about so many times before.\n\nItaly will persevere on, with or without a German ally.

The area has been traditionally populated with a significant proportion of German-speaking peoples who have been slow to integrate into Italy. Germany has offered to renounce their claim to Tyrol if we remove our guarantee of Austria. The benefits of such an agreement are twofold. The most immediate benefit is that our claim to Tyrol is solidified once and for all. Nobody else with the means to enforce such a claim can reasonably lay claim to the area. Secondly is a diplomatic opportunity to deepen relations between our two nations, possibly giving us an opening for an alliance later down the line. \n\nThere are those within our government who disagree with this course of action, however. To join an alliance with Germany, which would be the logical end result of such an agreement they argue, we would be subverting our own autonomy. Instead of allowing Austria to slip from our grasp, we must instead reinforce ties to the Austrian government and reject this agreement, which might in the future lead to a more formalized alliance between both our nations."

 ITA_Align_with_Germany.5.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The German Führer- Adolf Hitler arrived in Rome and was greeted by a thunderous applause of Italian fascists yesterday morning upon his arrival. Accompanied by leading figures of his government, Propaganda Minister- Dr Joseph Goebbels and Foreign Affairs Minister- Joachim Von Ribbentrop as well as a massive entourage of five hundred party officials, diplomats, security guards and journalists in three trains.\n\nThe visit comes almost one year after Mussolini’s famous visit to Germany in which the two leaders toured Germany and its various big cities. Hitler’s visit to Rome seems to have been arranged similarly, though on a bit smaller scale, devoting far more time to an in-depth tour of Rome, with a planned showing of the Italian fleet in Naples.\n\nRecent years have seen the relationship between the two powers develop considerably, with this latest meeting likely a prelude to a more formalized alliance. According to unconfirmed sources in Rome, the Fuhrer has been privately pressing Mussolini for a military alliance, a move that may only serve to further destabilize the political situation in Europe. Hitler and his entourage are expected to return to Germany by the end of the week, though the long term implications of this trip will likely be mulled over for weeks to come."

 ITA_Flavour_Events.1.d: "\"Wait… he's dead?\"\n\n\"Shot down by friendly fire, sir. Our batteries couldn't tell who he was when he was trying to land. By the time they realized, it was too late. Everyone on board perished.\"\n\nItalo Balbo. A long time friend, and a thorn in his side, gone. To think the great aviator would go down in a plane, it was all too poetic. Although politically exiling him as Governor of Libya was meant as punishment, he made great improvements to the colony. The time the two opened the northern highway along the Mediterranean was still fresh on his mind.\n\nEven if Balbo was a friend, he just…kept going against official orders. He constantly denounced our relationships with the Germans, and he kept stirring the pot, till the pot turned over. He was a good man, but a part of Mussolini couldn't help but feel relieved that he was gone. Sad, but relieved. \n\n\"Not to speak out of line, sir, but do you have any plans for a memorial, or are we moving forward?\" his aide asked gingerly.\n\nMussolini folded his arms in thought, turned away for a moment and then looked back at the aide, his eyes slightly reddened.\n\n\"Prepare my plane for Libya. I know a perfect highway that we can remember him by.\""

Both the English and Egyptians eventually agreed to our claim in Southern Libya after some deliberation in their governments. The Sarra Triangle, mostly made of sand desert, is seem as a win for the Italian soldiers and Il Duce himself! Even King Vittorio Emanuele III has remained silent on the subject. In his pleasure, Mussolini has recommended to the King that he add a jewel to his already weighty crown: King of all Lybians. The sovereign has not yet transmitted his response, but he will undoubtedly accept it!\n\nOf course, Lord Drummond was asked to dine with the Duce and his cabinet to celebrate this excellent news, which Mussolini himself described as "The biggest triumph of the Stresa Front to this day.""

Notably, we regard French Tunisia and all Abyssinian provinces as critical conquests for the Italian Kingdom's peoples.\nWe finally negotiated an agreement, the Mussolini-Laval Accord, after months of negotiations and despite the threat of war in Abyssinia.

In addition to this, the activities conducted by the Balilla will be expanded further, with near-daily meetings of the local wing becoming mandatory, while bigger activities such as marches, shooting exercises, or excursions to important places of Italian history should occur at least once a month.

If you are poor however you had to go to a poor school, in a poor neighbourhood, where you only could learn the basics of education before you had to once again go to work to support your family.\n\nIt is given that this state of affairs is unacceptable, robbing Italy of massive amounts of potential while creating a wedge and contempt between the classes.\n\nTo root out this problem, the NFP has decided to enact a reform of the school system, the Carta della Scuola. This new law will from now on allow less economically inclined citizens to visit prestigious schools through generous scholarship grants, while already existing schools in poorer areas will receive greater funding than their bourgeoise counterparts. Furthermore, the law will create state-sponsored night schools, which will allow manual workers to receive new experiences in specialized manual work, while unproductive, chronic students will be forced to finally contribute to society, by reducing the number of study titles an individual can hold."

The locals have had other ideas about that concept, however. For decades we have been bogged down fighting indigenous rebels associated with the Senussi order as well as the Cyrenaicans, both of whom seemingly refuse to integrate.\n\nDespite these setbacks, however, our decades of hard work in the region have not been in vain. Through a combination of intense §GItalianization programs§! alongside the promotion of Italian migration to the area, we have managed to carve out several ethnically Italian enclaves in §YLibya§!, and some within the government argue that Italy is closer now than ever to making §YLibya§! a true extension of Italy.

 ITA_Drain_the_Swamp_category_desc: "\n\n\n£decision_header_ITA_Draining_the_Swamps£\n\n\n\nItaly, despite having a landmass comparable to other large European nations such as the UK and Poland, suffers from a chronic need of land. Its territories are mountainous and hilly which ill-lend themselves to the development of agriculture and industry. However there is still unexploited flat land within our borders, ready to be cultivated. Unfortunately said land is covered by great swamps that need drainage which can only be accomplished by investing many man-hours of work and electric resources into the project. The Fascist Party will see that Italy's potential is brought out.\n\n                                      Drainage of: §O[This.Dynamic_ITA_Swamp_Name]§!\n                                              Stage of Drainage: [This.Dynamic_ITA_Swamp_Stage]\n            Next Stage of Drainage Effects: §Y[This.Dynamic_ITA_Swamp_Stage_Effects]§!\n                                                  Progressing at: [?ITA_Swamps_Progress_Monthly|%%1G]\n                                                    kW Produced: §G[?ITA_Swamps_kW_Produced]§!\n                                                     kW Upkeep: §R[?ITA_Swamps_kW_Upkeep]§!\n"
