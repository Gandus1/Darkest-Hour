 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.1.t: "The Halhamiao Incident"
 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.1.d: "A Mongolian cavalry unit ambushed a nearby Manchurian patrol stationed around the Khalkhin Temple yesterday morning. Several Japanese military advisors were overseeing the patrol setting up base along the lines when the ambush caught them off guard, killing the Manchurian soldiers near the cavalry force as well as several Japanese advisors and volunteers.\n\nThe Mongolian attack force was counter-attacked with a machine gun, resulting in severe casualties and injuries for the Mongolian cavalry unit. A few dozen Manchurian soldiers and Japanese volunteers were killed, along with one officer and a few commanders, while 23 to 40 Mongolian cavalry riders were killed, with many more injured from the estimated 90-man cavalry regiment."

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.13.d: "With the equipment we provided them, it appears that the bandits were successful in sabotaging the Japanese war effort in the region. According to reports, the bandits severely damaged Japanese railroads and successfully intercepted numerous small Japanese logistic columns.\n\nThis will undoubtedly be of great assistance to our frontline effort against Japanese forces. They cannot fight against our superior forces unless sufficient reinforcements arrive on time, and given their army's lack of supplies, we may be able to easily overrun them."

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.16.t: "Japanese Resistance Crumbles"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.16.d: "Our attack was a huge success, and the Japanese are fleeing for the hills! Because of our well-planned assault on the unprepared Japanese forward positions, they had no idea we had launched a full-scale assault until our tanks had broken deep into their lines and their resistance had completely crumbled!\n\nThere are now only a few lingering resistances in the region, which we will eliminate as soon as possible. This will almost certainly teach the Japanese a lesson and bring them closer to the bargaining table."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.16.A: "A great victory for the Red Army!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.17.t: "Assault Stalls Out"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.17.d: "Our assault on the Japanese has been stuttering, as we have been unable to breach their defences quickly enough before they can react. Now that more Japanese troops have arrived, we must declare this assault a failure; continuing the assault would be a waste of military resources. We must assess the situation, reorganise our troops, and plan a new offensive at a later time.\n\nHopefully, our next assault will be more successful than this stalled assault."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.17.A: "The Japanese are better than we think..."

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.18.t: "Japanese Rout Our Forces"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.18.d: "The attack has gone horribly wrong, and our troops have been routed by the Japanese forces! Not only did the assault fail because we did not break the enemy line, but the Japanese also counterattacked, shattering our forward element, completely disorganising our forces! We are now reorganising our remaining forces in order to hopefully stabilise the front line on our fallback position. This is a total disgrace for our army!\n\nThe Japanese will pay the price for this affront against us!"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.18.A: "A shameful display!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.19.t: "Mongolian Battalion Arrives"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.19.d: "The promised Mongolian reinforcement forces have arrived safely, bringing with them a full battalion of cavalry to aid us in our fight against the Japanese forces. It isn't much, but Mongolian forces don't have much to spare for this conflict in any case. At the very least, the cavalry battalion would be useful in future battles if we needed reconnaissance on Japanese positions and information on local terrain suitability for our forces."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.19.A: "A great addition to our forces."

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.20.t: "Mongolian Platoon Arrives"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.20.d: "The promised Mongolian forces have arrived, but their numbers appear to be greatly exaggerated: instead of a full battalion of men, only a platoon arrived at our position! This would be an awkward situation for both our diplomatic and military fronts, and the Mongolians would have to answer for it after the conflict was over. Still, this is better than nothing, and perhaps we can find a way to use them somehow in the future war effort against Japanese forces."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.20.A: "Damn it!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.21.t: "Mongolian Forces Desert"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.21.d: "We didn't expect much from the Mongolians, but this is a different story! Mongolian troops have deserted! The Mongolian forces' lack of discipline would be a major embarrassment for our diplomatic initiatives, as well as a minor setback to our overall war effort against the Japanese. To deal with the Japanese army, we will have to rely on our own forces. And filling the positions left vacant by the Mongolian army, the Japanese must be rejoicing at their temporary advantage..."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.21.A: "Cowards!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.22.t: "Successful Tank Offensive"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.22.d: "Today, our tank offensive made incredible progress! They have broken the Japanese line and crumbled their resistance, and are now driving deep into their rear lines, which we will simply clear out with our infantry to destroy the remaining fractured Japanese resistance that did not retreat. When this has been done, we will have won the battle in this region, which is likely to help tip the conflict in our favour. With more victories like this in the future, the Japanese will be forced to negotiate very soon."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.22.A: "A great victory!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.23.t: "Ineffective Tank Offensive"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.23.d: "Our tank offensive appears to be...unimpressive, to say the least. The assault has done significant damage to the Japanese, but has failed to break through the Japanese lines further. Without such a decisive victory, we will have to prolong the standoff and re-adjust our approach against the Japanese positions. Hopefully, our next offensives will be able to achieve a complete breakthrough against the Japanese forces and bring us victory in this minor conflict."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.23.A: "At least it wasn’t a bad attempt..."

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.24.t: "Harsh Freezes Out the Tanks"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.24.d: "We appear to have underestimated the climate in the far east; our tanks' lubricants and fuels are unprepared for the harsh weather and are now freezing. As a result, our tanks are now frozen in place before we have even begun preparing for an attack. We must cancel this operation, and we hope that our maintenance teams can salvage whatever is still reusable in these wreckages. Until further assistance arrives, we must hand over the initiative to the Japanese and wait for reinforcements."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.24.A: "Mother Nature works against us..."

 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.011.t: "Conflict at Lake Khasan"
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.011.d.JAP: "Since the beginning of the twentieth century, we and the Russians have had an extremely low level of trust in each other, which has culminated in several incidents, most notably the Russo-Japanese War. The Russians built the Chinese Eastern Railway to help connect their far-eastern lands to China, and the southern branch, known as the South Manchuria Railway, is now safely under our control and that of our Manchurian government. As a result, we maintain a military presence in the region to ensure that the Soviets do not get any stupid ideas, though this has recently been reduced due to our war in China.\n\nToday, however, tensions between our two countries have reached a boiling point in the Khasan region. One of their generals defected last month, providing valuable information about the state of their armed forces following the recent purges. Despite their nation's propaganda, the truth is that their army is weak, and now would be an excellent time to strike the Khasan region. After being asked to withdraw their forces from the hills west of Lake Khasan, they refused and continued to reinforce the area.\n\nWe have now ordered a small number of Kwantung divisions to assault their positions in the hope of dealing a crushing blow to their evil Communist nation. With the Emperor's will on our side, we'll send those poor socialists fleeing for their lives! It's impossible that we'll lose to them..."
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.011.d.SOV: "Since the beginning of the twentieth century, we and the Japanese have had an extremely low level of trust in each other, which has culminated in several incidents, most notably the Russo-Japanese War. The Chinese Eastern Railway was built by us Russians to help connect our far-eastern lands to China, and the southern branch, known as the South Manchuria Railway, is unfortunately under the control of the Japanese and their pesky Manchurian collaborators. As a result, we maintain a significant military presence in the region to ensure that our neighbours do not get any stupid ideas.\n\nToday, however, tensions between our two countries have reached a boiling point in the Khasan region. After we reinforced our border there with trenches and communication posts in response to a defection last month of one of our generals who gave the Japanese critical information about the state of our forces, they requested that we withdraw our forces from the hills west of Lake Khasan, which we, of course, refused.\n\nThis has resulted in a small number of Kwantung divisions assaulting our positions in the name of their pitiful empire. We are confident that our forces will chase the rabid imperialist dogs away, demonstrating the full might of the Red Army! If we were to lose, those in command would have some serious questions to answer..."
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.011.A: "TENNŌHEIKA BANZAI!"
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.011.B: "UUURRRAAA!"

 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.1.t: "Lake Khasan Incident - Defeat"
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.1.d: "Catastrophe! Disaster! Our losses have accumulated to the point where we have been pushed out of the hills near Lake Khasan after days of hard fighting. According to reports from the area, our forces were quickly repulsed after charging enemy positions. The sight of their friends being blown up by gunfire caused panic, causing any stability our frontline had to quickly crumble. This enabled the enemy to launch a devastating counterattack, sweeping past our defensive positions before digging themselves in once more. We were unable to retake the land we had lost after our men were routed, and all of our other attacks were unsuccessful.\n\nThis is a colossal failure. While this was primarily fought over a small area of land, and we would not have gained much if we had won, it does highlight our weaknesses in the field. Furthermore, once news reaches our nation's major cities, public morale may be shaken. For the time being, we must bury our dead, rethink our military strategy, and perhaps even downplay the magnitude of our defeat here."
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.1.A: "Someone will answer for this mess!"

 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.2.t: "Lake Khasan Incident - Close Defeat"
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.2.d: "Unfortunately, we learned today that our soldiers were beaten at Lake Khasan. While our forces were not completely destroyed, we were forced to retreat after days of hard fighting. According to officers fighting, we were on the defensive for the majority of the time there, and while things appeared to be going our way at first, the tide began to turn slowly as the enemy began to bring in more firepower to support their units.\n\nThis had a significant impact on the engagement, as we found ourselves conceding more and more ground in the latter stages of the fighting, to the point where we could no longer contest control of the hills near Lake Khasan.\n\nThere is no doubt that this is a disappointing outcome, but we must consider the positives. We were able to inflict significant casualties on the enemy, ensuring that they bled for every mile of land they took. Furthermore, the forces that survived have gained valuable combat experience, and we may see some new officers emerge from their ranks. For the time being, the defeat is bitter, but we will return stronger."
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.2.A: "We must learn from our mistakes immediately."

 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.3.t: "Lake Khasan Incident - Stalemate"
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.3.d: "After days of bitter and bloody fighting with enemy forces at Lake Khasan, a ceasefire has been declared, as neither we nor our adversary has gained enough ground to push each other back. This is not the desired outcome, but we will take it over being beaten and forced to retreat. Both sides' carefully planned assaults and defensive manoeuvres frequently meant that, while our offensives frequently resulted in heavy casualties, our positions on the hills allowed us to mount strong defences against their attacks.\n\nBecause neither side could make a breakthrough, our officers reached an agreement with the enemy to call a ceasefire. We should be proud of ourselves for holding off the enemy, even if there isn't much to show for it, and it's almost certain that our adversary will spin this story in their favour. However, the high command stated that it was a good experience for our soldiers, so that is one positive from this skirmish."
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.3.A: "A bloody and tiring mess, all nothing."

 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.4.t: "Lake Khasan Incident - Pyrrhic Victory"
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.4.d: "Good news has reached the capital today, as our forces defeated the enemy at Lake Khasan, albeit at a higher cost to our generals. The fighting was tough, and it appeared at first that we would not be able to breach the enemy lines, but with skillful assaults by our officers and some tactical blunders on the enemy's part, we were able to show great resilience and win the skirmish.\n\nThis is a good result, even though it took a lot of resources and men to achieve it. The enemy fought valiantly, but not effectively enough to halt our advance. The soldiers who fought there will have invaluable experience that they will use in future battles. We must now ensure that any errors in our planning are corrected. This is a victory, but we have paid dearly in blood."
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.4.A: "A victory, but at what cost?"

 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.5.t: "Lake Khasan Incident - Victory"
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.5.d: "Today, high command is celebrating our stunning victory over our adversaries at Lake Khasan! After the enemy launched a disastrous attack against our brave soldiers, we displayed a dominant display of our armed forces, remaining on top throughout the entire skirmish. Their frontline collapsed due to a significant drop in morale, and our boys, fueled by victory, launched a counterattack that sent them fleeing to the hills with their tails between their legs! Our flag was planted on the hills surrounding Lake Khasan to demonstrate that we have complete control of the area.\n\nThis victory will be celebrated at home, which will undoubtedly boost public morale. The soldiers who fought there deserve a medal or two for their bravery, and the experience they gained will be extremely valuable to their army careers. This victory demonstrates that our doctrine is correct, and we will undoubtedly benefit from it in our propaganda efforts."
