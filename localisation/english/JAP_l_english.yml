 JAP_Flavor.1.t: "The Lytton Report"
 JAP_Flavor.1.d: "The League of Nations has published a report today concerning us and our actions in Manchuria. This Lytton Report is a paper on the findings of the Lytton Commission, a five-member commission headed by British politician The Earl of Lytton meant to evaluate the Mukden Incident, the event which led to our nation’s seizure of Manchuria. \n\nThe group spent six weeks in Manchuria in spring 1932 (despite having been sent in December 1931) on a fact-finding mission after they had met government leaders in the Republic of China and in Japan. Regarding Manchukuo, the Report concluded that the new State could not have been formed without the presence of Japanese troops; that it had no general Chinese support; and that it was not part of a genuine and spontaneous independent movement. \n\nClearly, this report is a blatant attack on Japan and our allies in Asia. They claim that our grievances were legitimate, but then turn and claim our actions to rectify the situation were not? China was never going to give us our rightful reparations for the disrespect they earned when they bombed our railway at Mukden. It was not only our right, but our prerogative to move into Manchuria and rectify the situation. In light of how the League of Nations has seemingly turned against us on this issue, perhaps we should move to review our participation in the organization as a whole."
 JAP_Flavor.1.A: "Yet more international bias against Japan."

 JAP_Flavor.2.t: "Our Withdrawal from the League of Nations"
 JAP_Flavor.2.t.GER: "Japan Defies the League and Walks Out."
 JAP_Flavor.2.t.ALL: "Japan Withdraws from the League of Nations"
 JAP_Flavor.2.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The gall of an organization like the League of Nations to criticize our actions in Asia with their Lytton Report, while so blatantly pandering to imperialistic Western empires like Britain or France is the pinnacle of hypocrisy, and quite frankly revolting. There are millions of Africans, Indians, and Southeast Asians under foreign dominion that have never seen the fruits of their so-called democracies. \n\nYet when a nation in the East begins to assert itself on the world stage, they draw up such insulting documents like the Lytton report, and propose sanctions on us. No more. Our entire delegation to the League walked out of the Assembly Hall, heads held high. \n\nEffective immediately, Japan will no longer be a part of the League of Nations. With our having already sent in the proper documentation to notify the organization of our withdrawal, we will no longer be restricted by that petty eurocentric regulatory pushover. \n\nWhat’s in motion now has already been set in motion. If they pursue sanctions over Manchuria, it will be just as if we had not joined the organization to begin with. Thus, there is no need to maintain the facade any longer. We will no longer constrain ourselves in fear of international retribution. Our actions in Asia have only strengthened us. To steer from this course now would be to deny our destiny as a world power."
 JAP_Flavor.2.d.GER: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The Imperial State of Japan delivered today a message to Geneva announcing its intentions to withdraw from the League of Nations. Citing the appointment of the Lytton Commission, a committee assembled to evaluate the Mukden incident and the legality of Japan’s invasion of China, and various condemnations of Japan’s expansion in Asia, Japan argued that an anti-Japanese sentiment existed within the League, and that the only logical course of action was to leave.\n\nAnd leave they did. They entire Japanese delegation followed their chief diplomat, right out of the Assembly Hall, stunning the entire room and the world. \n\nThe League, already considered by some to be an ineffectual organization without the backing of the United States, now finds itself on ever more tenuous ground. Other important members of the organization, such as Italy and Germany, have also indicated an opposition to many of the League’s goals and actions and are reportedly at risk of withdrawing themselves. \n\nInternational observers have commented that should the League fail to apply appropriate retaliatory measures for Japan’s violation of international law as determined by the Lytton Commission, it will only embolden others to follow in Japan’s footsteps. With the League’s credibility on the line, rapid action may be necessary to keep it from failing completely."

 # Aizawa Incident
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.1.t: "A Plot Unraveled"
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.1.d: "Captain Tsuji Masanobu was in shock. He had always had a dislike for the Kodoha, their rhetoric was a bit too aggressive, even for him. All that talk of creating a new military government to secure Japan once and for all put him off from the organization. But to organize a coup against the government? It was more than mere conjecture, it was treason! And in the Imperial Japanese Army Academy no less.\n\n“Sir?”, Cadet Sato asked, a worried look on his face.\n\nThe captain’s head snapped back towards his cadet, apparently broken from his brief trance.\n\n“Thank you for the information, cadet. The situation will be dealt with shortly. You are dismissed.” \n\nThe captain fell back into his seat as his cadet left the room. According to his cadet, there were only seven of them, five cadets and two officers. Theoretically, he could handle the matter himself. However, if these other reports about a secret ultranationalist organization called “The Sakurakai” are to be believed, it’s possible this conspiracy goes even further beyond what the cadet was aware of. \n\nNo, this matter was too grave to be handled alone. The captain wiped his face briefly before turning his gaze to the telephone on his desk. The authorities needed to know about this threat immediately. Captain Tsuji Masanobu picked up the receiver to his telephone and started dialing."
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.1.A: "“Get me the Major General of the Kempeitai.”"

 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.2.t: "A Disgraced Genius"
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.2.d: "Jinzaburō Masaki looked at the resignation in front of him with anger. It was ridiculous! Absolutely unbelievable! All he had done to climb the ranks of the military, to serve his country, only to be discarded like this? He had fought in the Russo-Japanese war. He had graduated from the military college top of his class. He had clawed his way up the military ranks at a blistering rate, from an entry level second lieutenant on the front lines to a three-star lieutenant general, a climb that was almost unheard of considering his background. He performed his duties as Inspector-General of Military Education excellently.\n\nAnd yet, Masaki knew this was the end of his career. Someone had to take the fall for allowing the coup to have progressed as far as it did, and he was the perfect scapegoat. If it wasn’t bad enough he had been in charge of military education, and the coup had been plotted from within the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, he had also been associated with the Kodoha faction for years, the political faction from where the plot originated. All his hard work undone by a few foolhardy students playing general! \n\nThe aging general suddenly felt very weary. Perhaps it was best his climb to the top was at an end. He had lost his appetite for war long ago. Serving in Manchuria against the Russians had ensured that distaste. Additionally, his successor, Major General Tetsuzan Nagata, seemed competent enough to take over after him. There was naught much else for him to do now anyways. The general slowly turned his eyes back to the resignation in front of him, and picked up a pen."
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.2.A: "\"I, Jinzaburō Masaki, tender my resignation…\""

 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.3.t: "Restoration of Military Discipline"
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.3.d: "Tokyo may have avoided a looming crisis this week as a group of radical Kodoha-aligned students and officers have gone to trial for planning a coup. While none of the conspirators will face criminal charges due to lack of solid evidence, the report of Cadet Sato proved worrying enough for the Army War College to expel five cadets. Two junior officers implicated with the plot, Lieutenant Colonel Muranaka and Lieutenant Isobe, were also suspended from military service.\n\nWith Kodoha attempts to minimize the connection between themselves and the plotters falling on deaf ears, many government and military officials associated with the faction have been replaced, among them Major General Jinzaburō Masaki, Inspector-General of Military Education.\n\nMasaki’s successor, the more moderate Major General Tetsuzan Nagata, has signaled his intention to root out treasonous organizations that Masaki either allowed through inaction or perhaps even directly supported."
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.3.A: "Thank goodness."

 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.4.t: "The Brave Man's Song"
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.4.d: "The man arrived in downtown Tokyo early in the morning. He’d always enjoyed the city, even if he was more accustomed to his more rural home up north. He immersed himself in the mass of humanity around him- the sights, the sounds, and the smells of the city made him feel alive. \n\nThe man had no time to enjoy such things today. He had a mission to fulfill. To an outside observer, it might seem strange that a man would wear something so large and heavy as an overcoat on a day as bright and temperate as this one was. After all, it was spring, the most beautiful time of the year in Tokyo. One seldom assumes what such coat may conceal beneath its folds. \n\nIt didn’t take long for him to arrive at his destination- an old, drab government building whose grey concrete had grown increasingly worn over the years. It was at this point that the man noticed just how heavy he felt. It wasn’t just what he was carrying, though that too felt strangely heavy, but a sense of dread. It felt like a warning. As if he shouldn’t be doing this. However, he knew it was too late now. His military career was over, his life gone- this would be his final destination. \n\nSecurity was lax as he walked in. Just a few weary desk jockeys languishing under an endless pile of paperwork and some bored-looking guards off to the side. When he asked the way to Tetsuzan Nagata’s office, they just pointed down the hall. Strangely, so close to his destination, he noticed that he had suddenly ceased to feel anything. It was as though nothing mattered to him anymore. He felt spiritually balanced in a way as he walked into the office and closed the door behind him. Nagata had hardly enough time to lift his head before the man’s concealed weapon came out, a sword gleaming in the sunlight streaming into the room, and further, hardly enough time to widen his eyes before the blade came down."
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.4.A: "A few seconds is all it takes."

 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.5.t: "The Dark Genius"
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.5.d: "When news of the attempted coup had come to light in the Japanese diet, there was at first confusion and then outrage. How could the Kodoha, even an isolated cell of that faction, consider overthrowing the government? Had they no love for their country? Yet none were more confused or more outraged than the Kodoha themselves. \n\nMany within the Kodoha Faction believe that Cadet Sato, the former conspirator who informed authorities of the plot, had been a spy for Captain Tsuji all along- and that the affair was a Tōseiha scheme to discredit Inspector-General of Military Education General Jinzaburō Masaki. The choice of his replacement, Tōseiha-aligned General Watanabe Jotaro, seemed to confirm Kodoha suspicions, giving rise to calls for vengeance from within their ranks.\n\nWith inter-factional tensions at a high point, lieutenant colonel Saburō Aizawa further escalated the crisis, deciding to avenge the honor of both the Kodoha and Masaki by murdering Nagata in his office. Aizawa's actions may also have been motivated by doctrinal disputes between himself and Nagata, whose national mobilization strategy he found deeply offensive. Until his untimely death, Nagata had advocated preparing both the military and civilian economy for total war, which Aizawa perceived as collusion with corrupt party politics and the zaibatsu. \n\nAizawa may have achieved his perceived justice by killing Nagata, but in doing so, he has discredited the Kodoha Faction more than the Tōseiha ever could. With the whole nation mourning Nagata's death, What little influence the Kodoha still hold is quickly slipping away."

 # Teijin Incident - End of Saito Cabinet
 JAP_Teijin_Incident.1.t: "The Raging Bull of Taihoku"
 JAP_Teijin_Incident.1.d: "Despite the fervent economic downturn that has plagued the rest of the globe, Japan has soldiered on, literally. In 1932 alone, the Empire’s GDP grew by an astonishing 5%, fueled by the continued militarization and new conquests in Manchuria. The more Nippon takes, the more opportunities arise for making a quick couple thousand yen.\n\nTaihoku Prefecture, originally known as the island of Formosa, has been a part of the Empire since 1895 after the Sino-Japanese Conflict. A constant process of integration, Taihoku is considered the model colony of the empire, an extension of the Home Islands. So much so, the Bank of Taiwan regularly maintains stock listings for the Kabushiki Torihikijo, the exchange in metropolitan Tokyo. The ticker tape never stops. \n\nJust this morning, a group of young investors made a substantial purchase of 100,000 shares of Teijin Limited, a leading textile firm. Savvy stockholders that they are, this group, known as the Banchokai, now have a firm entrance into the Rayon industry within Nippon. And at only ¥125 per share, a potential profit is sure to be had for them! A golden chance taken at just the right moment!"
 JAP_Teijin_Incident.1.A: "Tick, tick, tick, tick..."

 JAP_Teijin_Incident.2.t: "A Financial Conundrum"
 JAP_Teijin_Incident.2.d: "ROTTEN TO THE CORE: FINANCE MINISTRY BEHIND TEIJIN INSIDER TRADING? \n\nThat was the headline flashed across the Abatake editorial page, early this morning. Inside the article itself, an unknown writer laid out a ‘bribery’ scandal in detail, claiming that advisors inside the Ministry of Finance were behind a scheme to give the Banchokai investors an “insider trading tip”, before the stock of Teijin Corporation Ltd. rose dramatically over the previous 6 months. He then asserted the venture went all the way to the top leadership of the Bank of Taiwan, with Shigeru Shimada, President, directly involved. That wasn’t even the end of it. By the final sentence, ministers in the Finance, Commerce, Industry and even Railroad Ministries had all been named in the article, baselessly.\n\nOf course, the implications are totally ludicrous and unfounded. The Ministry of Finance had no idea that the Teijin stock purchase even took place! There is simply no way they can manage and maintain every single stock purchase and selling on a daily basis. Moreover, Shimada has a legitimate alibi, showing he was not aware of the ongoing selling of Teijin’s stocks. As usual in Japan, the press is used as a silly tool to try and derail any sense of good government with the NUC. \n\nHowever, all that said, everyone is reading it. All across Osaka, Tokyo and even Kyoto itself, the Abatake paper is seen everywhere. The politicians, the bankers, the shopkeepers and even the vagrants are all consuming the article as a state of fact! Within the government itself, there are rumblings of instability everywhere, with Ichiro Hatoyama, Minister of Education, outwardly saying he will resign shortly. \n\nWhoever it was that wrote this, they have created a scandal unlike any before it, almost totally out of thin air. And within the Empire, scandals almost always lead to disaster…"
 JAP_Teijin_Incident.2.A: "The horizon of the Rising Sun grows dark."

 JAP_Teijin_Incident.3.t: "A Disgraced Minister"
 JAP_Teijin_Incident.3.d: "Despite any major proof, despite any real subjective evidence, and despite the sworn statements from most members of cabinet, the political situation in Tokyo has descended into turmoil, all on the heels of the unknown editorial published six months ago. What was once thought to be a simple tabloid piece has now inflamed all of government, leaving many political observers stunned at the smoldering crisis.\n\nIt started with Ichiro Hatoyama, Minister of Education, resigning a mere two weeks after the editorial showed up. Then, more editorials began to appear in other papers. While they are mostly rehashes of the original content, like the first, people are clamoring to read them. From the proles to the proppers, the citizens of the nation are captivated by this total farce. A self-immolating flame, keeping the story alive. And as if the fire wasn’t strong enough, members of our own National Government have just poured kerosene on the embers.\n\nLate last night, the Ministry of Justice, led by the fervent ultra-nationalist Hiranuma Kiichiro, issued warrants of arrest for the Vice-Minister of Finance, director of the Bank of Taiwan and the President of the Teijin Cooperation himself. Kiichiro has appointed himself the chief prosecutor in the case, and while a trial could prove the Cabinet’s innocence, the proceedings could last for months and would cast a terrible light on the NUC. One that Saito is not willing to allow.\n\nWith the expectation of even more warrants for cabinet members to be issued shortly, the Prime Minister is asking all his advisors to resign, en masse."

 # Hirota Cabinet
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.1.t: "2.26 Incident"
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.1.d: "\"How could this be happening?\", asked Shirō Nonaka to no one in particular. It was a fair enough question. For someone who believed his group had the divine will of the Emperor behind them, victory should have been imminent. And yet, here he stood in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police headquarters, about to be stormed by the army. He glanced out the window to the army regiments outside, and then to the pistol on his side. He unholstered it and gazed at the inscriptions on its side.\n\nThe plan had started so well. He and a few other IJA officers had mobilized over a thousand other young army soldiers to storm several important administrative centers in Tokyo. They assassinated some of the most prominent enemies of the kokutai, then submitted their demands, the dismissal of several officers in opposition to their goals and the appointment of a new cabinet led by Mazaki. The rest would have been decided by the Emperor once he recognized the righteousness of our goals. They had failed, though.\n\nNonaka slammed his fists against the wall in anger. They never gained any support from the Emperor, nor did they gain any concessions. Three days had passed, and their positions had only weakened in that time. At that very moment, thousands upon thousands of soldiers stood at their doorsteps ready to attack their position. They would almost certainly be overrun, and he would likely be put before a firing squad. Unless…\n\nHe gave a final glance at his pistol before closing his eyes and putting the barrel to the side of his head."

 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.2.t: "The Scattered Sakura"
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.2.d: "Saionji Kinmochi sat back and watched from afar as men cleared out cabinets and desks all about the government building. It was a sobering moment as he watched those government men take away any trace of those who had come before. It was as if the Kodoha faction had been wiped from the face of the earth, its members either dead or in prison. Not that Sionji had ever supported the group, in fact he had spent a great deal of time opposing their aims. However, to imagine that all of this could have occurred could have been inconceivable to the man a few years ago. \n\nRegardless, he reflected, life moves on. Japan’s political scene was in total disarray, and he was in a position to take advantage of this chaos. While the Toseiha faction is now firmly in control of the government, individual factions within the Toseiha are all vying for power in this new political dynamic. This disorganized state of affairs was only compounded by the resignation of the Okada cabinet, leaving another big power vacuum open that could only wait for so long. \n\nThe elder statesman rose from his seat watching the building across the way and started on the road back down into Tokyo. The political landscape had indeed shifted, and he had every intention of taking advantage of it. The Toseiha faction would be brought into line, and with it Saionji would mold a new Japan."
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.2.A: "There can only be one."

 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.3.t: "Approaching the Prince"
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.3.d: "Saionji Kinmochi could not believe what he was hearing from his former apprentice. He was giving Konoe the opportunity of a lifetime, ascension to the Prime Ministership of Japan. One of the most powerful positions in government, and yet he was refusing?\n\n“You understand what I am offering to you here”, asked the elder statesman, somewhat incredulously, “You would have near unlimited legislative control of the government.”\n\n“I’m sorry”, the younger man responded, taking care to look at his former master directly, “The political situation is too unstable right now. A failure at this juncture could kill my political career. As flattered as I am, I cannot accept this position.”\n\nThe two had been talking for well over two hours, and yet their conversation had gone nowhere. As the younger Konoe turned to leave, Saionji felt an incredible frustration well up inside him. He had hinged his plans on having Konoe in office. He had molded the boy, made him into a fine politician, and now he turns his back on the man who made him. Admittedly, the two had grown distant in the years since their time at the Kyoto Imperial University, but he still trusted him\n\nFine! If Konoe wouldn’t do it, he just had to substitute in someone else. Someone diplomatic and inoffensive. Someone to bridge the gap between Okada’s term and the future. However, with Japanese politics as volatile as it was right now, who could possibly keep the peace? It was then when the idea struck him. It wouldn’t be perfect, but it would just have to hold everyone over until someone better could be found for the prime ministership. He signalled to his attendant to bring him the phone."
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.3.A: "Hello operator? Get me Kōki Hirota."

 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.4.t: "The Diplomat in Reserve"
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.4.d: "As the speaker droned on with his speeches and formalities, Saionji couldn’t help but wonder if this was really his best option. Keeping this government together could prove difficult, even with a man as inoffensive as Kōki Hirota. In recent months he had increasingly seen the military as a threat to Japan’s continued stability. Rising aggression and demands on the part of the military was starting to erode civilian control over the government, and while Hirota had certainly displayed excellent compromise and negotiation skills in the past, negotiating with these kinds of people might prove impossible. \n\n“... hereby inaugurate Kōki Hirota as Prime Minister”\n\nSnapped out of his abstraction, Saionji began to clap with the rest of the crowd as Hirota approached the podium and began to speak. As Hirota progressed deeper into the speech, Saionji pondered on the councillors on either side of him. These spineless fools were who allowed the political situation to get as volatile as it has. If they don’t start harder stances against military incursion on civilian governmental powers, all could be lost.\n\nAs Hirota wrapped up his speech and the Diet began to clap in one last big applause, Saionji could only watch the man as he stepped down from the podium and began to shake hands and talk with the influential members around him."
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.4.A: "Godspeed, Kōki Hirota."

 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.5.t: "The General Demands Arita"
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.5.d: "“This is ridiculous! Outrageous! How could they possibly demand such a thing! Kōki Hirota had been fuming over the military's latest demand for hours now. The military had objected to the appointment of Shigeru Yoshida to Hirota's cabinet, and instead suggested one Hachirō Arita, a Diet member with ties to the military who had been pushing for Japan to go to war with the rest of Asia for years. Saionji had warned the man of what becoming Prime MInister would entail, but Hirota had never expected such bold disregard for government tradition.\n\nHirota glared angrily at the note on his desk that had requested this appointment on the military’s behalf. Those pigheaded military men seemed intent in challenging him at every juncture. They had voiced opposition to his appointment from the very beginning, and he knew demands like these were meant to further disorganize and derail his administration. And he also knew that he couldn’t yet afford to burn bridges with these people. \n\nHe forced himself to take a breath before picking up his pen and signing off on the appointment of Hachirō Arita to the cabinet. It was a bitter pill to swallow, but he did not need Yoshida in his cabinet to function. This new government administration would survive."
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.5.A: "Now all I need is something for the headache..."

 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.6.t: "The Cabinet Research Bureau"
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.6.d: "Bureaucracy is an important part of any functioning government, a fact that Mori knew well. If nothing else, his twenty-five years of service for the government of Japan had taught him that. It didn’t change the fact that Mori hated his job. Day in and day out, he came into the office a haggard facsimile of a man, grouchy and quick to anger. He loathed the seemingly eternal drudgery of writing report after report, answering calls, and reading telegrams all day.\n\nOne might wonder why a man would put himself through such torture at a job they hated so much. It was not as though he couldn’t find work elsewhere. He had years of experience. No, the truth is that Mori had a secret. He was one of the most powerful men in Japan. On his small worn desk in his tiny cramped office sat a small brass plaque that read: Head of the Cabinet Research Bureau. At first glance, it was just a small office,  with rarely enough space for mountains of paperwork that got shoveled through. Nevertheless, it was responsible for all bureaucratic coordination and policy implementation in the Japanese government.\n\nThe effect of this was that Mori had the power to sink entire administrations should he so choose. With the right ink on the right paper, Mori could ensure the failure of any government programs he wished. Or, if he so chooses, Mori could grind the government to a halt by destroying the bureaucracy’s top-down coordination. Mori could neutralize any movement or opposition to the government by suffocating any opposition in red tape.\n\nAnd though he had never felt the need to act on this power, the fact that he could keep him going. His office kept the government’s bureaucratic organs functioning well with one another and making sure policy rollouts succeeded. Despite his cramped office and creaky old desk, he nonetheless kept on, proud in the secret knowledge that he was the most powerful man in Japan."

 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.7.t: "The National Defense State?"
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.7.d: "Baba Eiichi was a man with a simple understanding of the world. Though he was no communist, Mao likely summarized his views best when he said, \"Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun\". It was a quote that had been bounding about in his head recently, and for good reason. Some months ago he found himself appointed Home Minister of Japan, and since that fateful day he had been working diligently towards ensuring that if power came from the gun, Japan would have the biggest one.\n\nIt was for this reason he was chuckling to himself so profusely as he put the final stamp and seal on the new budget for the Japanese government in the year of 1937. A 40% increase in total expenditures over the previous year, this budget made extensive funds available for all sorts of military purposes including the building of new recruitment infrastructure, the purchase of new armaments and weapons, as well as substantive increase in pay and benefits for officers and generals within the army and navy.\n\nA worthy beginning, to be sure, but not certainly not enough for a man like Baba Eiichi. His, as well as those who had put him there, ultimate object was a state built around that eternal engine of human progress, war. Japan would be victorious in goal, destined to rule the eight corners of the world unchallenged, or it would perish trying."

 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.8.t: "The General and the Politician"
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.8.d: "\"How can you, and in truth most members of this diet, continue to bring such disloyalty and dishonor upon our distinguished military? How can you insult us so?\", asked General Hisaichi Terauchi. The general had been yelling at him for minutes on end now. As a member of the Rikken Seiyūkai and speaker of the house, Kunimatsu Hamada represented the military’s greatest obstacle to complete control of the government.\n\n \"Dishonor? Insult? I have done no such things, and I’ll commit harakiri if such accusations are proven otherwise. Perhaps you ought to do the same\", retorted the elder statesman. Instantaneously he realized what he had said.\n\nIt was a rare thing to get silence in the House of Representatives. While a certain measure of decorum was enforced in the chamber, there were always side conversations, people shuffling around, the crinkling of paper. Total silence was wildly uncommon. And yet, Kunimatsu Hamada had achieved just that.\n\nAnd yet, after a moment, one statesman stood up. He stood alone for a moment, before another representative beside rose up as well. Then another rose, and another, before the entire hall stood together in solidarity with the speaker of the house. The general angrily stared back at Kunimatsu before turning, and walking straight out of the House of Representatives building."
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.8.A: "Civilian governance stands firm against military dominance."

 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.9.t: "The Only Option"
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.9.d: "It was over. Kōki Hirota’s prime ministership had reached the end of the line. He looked mournfully around his office as he struggled with his resignation letter. He had tried, truly he had. He had mediated, compromised, gave concessions, everything. But one damned incident in the house of representatives, and all his previous military support, however minimal it may have been, completely disappeared.\n\nHe didn’t know truly whether they feared he was stoking some kind of anti-military sentiment, or just chose to boot him as a message to others that no government could operate without military support, but either way it no longer mattered to him. Continuing this government as its leader was simply no longer possible. Treading on the military’s tail was dangerous, and operating without their support, even a tacit amount of it, could bring about the end of civilian government as a whole. God knows what would happen if the military ever decided to take matters into their own hands\n\nHe sighed as he looked over the words of his resignation over and over again. Even in defeat he sought to ensure his loss was one of grace and humility. He wondered if anyone would even care to read the resignation."
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.9.A: "Japan moves onward. It must."

 # Hayashi Cabinet
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.1.t: "Cleaning the Mess"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.1.d: ""What an impossible situation," reflected Saionji Kinmochi on the current state of Japanese politics. He had nominated ten Prime Ministers as the last surviving Genrō, all of whom were relatively simple choices. Simply elect the President of the majority party in the Diet and wait for reinforcements the army and navy to back it up.\n\nBut this time was different. Kinmochi knew he was at the mercy of the military this time, with the previous Prime Minister, Hirota, reinstating the military's vast control over the government.\n\nKazushige Ugaki appeared to be the clear winner. He could be the right person to solve Japan's current political problems, with a moderate foreign policy and opposition to the military's increasingly fascistic trends. But would the military back him up? After all, they were heavily influenced by fascistic ideals at this point. Perhaps they'll agree, or perhaps they'll flatly refuse? What would he d-\n\n"Honourable Genrō, may I suggest a candidate?" a voice interrupted Kinmochi's thoughts. Fumimaro Konoe was his protege.\n"Speak up, my son." Kinmochi's voice did little to conceal his interest and curiosity. "Senjr Hayashi." Had his protégé found a way out of a situation that he himself thought was impossible? As he handed over some prepared papers to his old mentor, Konoe said.\n\nAs he flipped through them, Kinmochi's face became concerned. Right-wing, expansionist, increased military power... this man seemed to embody everything he was against. Kinmochi suspected Konoe was drawn to fascism, but he had no idea how strong the attraction was. Putting forward a candidate for Prime Minister with whom he would never agree? What in the world was Konoe thinking?\n\nOn the other hand, Konoe could be correct. Putting Hayashi in charge may help to appease the military and bring them under control. Who knows, maybe the right-wing candidate will be the one to restore the status quo."
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.1.A: "Konoe's suggestion is worth considering."
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.1.B: "No, Ugaki is still our best choice."

 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.2.t: "Konoe's Gambit"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.2.d: "Seeing Kinmochi contemplate on his suggestion, Konoe doubled down. "Master, Kazushige Ugaki... he doesn't have the support of the military. In fact, the military likely hates him for everything that happened to them during his tenure as Army Minister."\n\n"He is the most moderate minister we have, Konoe. He's the only one completely opposed to the rising fascism in the military too." Kinmochi responded.\n\n"I mean no disrespect, honourable Genrō, but isn't that exactly what makes it likely that the army will kill his cabinet before it even gets started? Or have you forgotten that they now have the ability to destabilize civilian governments at their whim?" Konoe argued back, his tone becoming more assertive and his demeanor more aggressive.\n\n"My protégé, please be patient. Do not let fear of the military control your thinking." Kinmochi answered calmly.\n\nFor a brief moment, Konoe closed his eyes and collected himself. "I'm sorry, my most revered Master, but in my opinion, Hayashi is a far more viable option than Ugaki. Hayashi may be right-wing, but he is not a fascist. And a right-wing but capable Prime Minister is preferable to none at all."\n\n"You may be right, my child." Kinmochi sighed. Konoe certainly had a point.\n\nAfter all, Hayashi wasn't such a bad candidate. While Ugaki would have been a better choice, Kinmochi was well aware of the military's opposition to his appointment. While he despised having to choose a Prime Minister under military constraints, he recognized he had no choice. With a heavy sigh, he finally came to the conclusion that Hayashi was indeed the best choice in these circumstances."
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.2.A: "Let's see what Hayashi can do to improve the situation."

 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.3.t: "The Marshal of Korea"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.3.d: "Kazushige Ugaki walked with his collar straightened. He was uneasy about having all eyes on him as he walked to his destination. Saionji Kinmochi had summoned him. Ugaki was well aware that Kinmochi was the last surviving Genrō, and that Kinmochi held high regard for him. As such, he knew, with some certainty, why he was called.\n\nBut he hoped that was not the case.\n\nAs he entered, Kinmochi greeted him graciously, "Ah, Kazushige Ugaki. The Marshal of Korea. Thank you for coming before me."\n"It is a great honour, respectable Genrō." Ugaki said, as he bowed his most respectful bow.\n"Ah, yes, Genrō. That I am." Kinmochi sighed. "You also know, of course, that it means I have the responsibility of nominating the next Prime Minister?"\n"Of course, sir."\n"I have chosen you, Kazushige."\n\nThe collar tightened around Ugaki's throat. The position's responsibilities made him feel suffocated. "Sir, your choice has humbled me greatly. I will accept this position fully intending to carry out my responsibilities and lead this country to the best of my ability."\n\nKinmochi sighed. "You have my blessings and my best wishes. This is not an easy job. But I know you will do excellently." He smiled.\nUgaki returned the smile, turned, and walked away without saying anything.\n\nBoth of their smiles vanished as soon as Ugaki left. They were both aware that this was far from over. They knew the battle had only just begun."
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.3.A: "Hopefully Ugaki was the right choice."

 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.4.t: "Army Threatens the Ugaki Cabinet"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.4.d: "It took Ishiwara a few more minutes to join the men in his room. When he saw them, he sighed in annoyance. But he quickly brought upon a smile on his face, and greeted Kinmochi.\n\n"Most respectable Genrō, it is an honour to meet you." He said, bowing respectfully.\nThen he turned to Ugaki. Ugaki smiled. "General Ugaki." he said with a scowl on his face, bowing for but a second. Ugaki's feeble smile withered away.\n\nTrying his best to ignore Ishiwara's disrespect for him, Ugaki began as Ishiwara went ahead and sat down in his seat. "General Ishiwara, as I'm sure you already know, the honourable Genrō here has nominated me as the next Prime Minister. As such, I am here to request that you nominate an Army Min-"\n"The military does not support your cabinet." Ishiwara said calmly.\n\nUgaki could feel his calm fading. "But why?" he nearly screamed.\n"As Army Minister, you have significantly weakened the military. I'm sure you recall the March Incident. Your tenure as Marshal of Korea hasn't been kind to you either."\n"What exactly do you mean?"\n"General Ugaki, your ties to the zaibatsu are no secret. We know you got to know them well during your time in Korea."\n"But-"\n"General, the decision is final." Ishiwara instructed them to leave in the most polite manner possible.\n\nKinmochi said not one word. As he thought about it, Kinmochi realised there was another choice, one that his protégé had recommended: Senjūrō Hayashi."
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.4.A: "Ugaki's cabinet is clearly dead. Time to move on."

 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.5.t: "Public Outcry over the Ugaki Debacle"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.5.d: ""Takahiro, have you read today's news? Ugaki's cabinet is no more." said Asahi, as he sipped on a cup of tea and pored over the Asahi Shimbun.\n"What did you expect, gentlemen? Ugaki destroyed the military when he was Army Minister, he definitely should not get to be Prime Minister then." said the shop owner as he brought a cup of tea over to Takahiro's table.\n"But what does Ugaki's tenure as Army Minister have to do with him being a civilian Prime Minister?" Asahi enquired. "And why do the military have so much power over who takes care of civilian business?"\n\nTakahiro quietly sipped his tea as he listened.\n"I think its because Minister Hirota had to calm the military down after that February 26 Incident."\n"Ah, yes, the military organizes a coup and after that, they get more power. Tell me, Hachiro, in what world does that make sense?" retorted Asahi, his voice getting more and more aggressive.\n\nThe shop owner said nothing as he quietly brewed tea.\n"The military shouldn't have this much power over civilian matters. The purpose of it is to protect the civilians, not to meddle in civilian affairs!" continued Asahi. Now that he knew he had no opposition, he could say anything he wanted. "Does the civilian government have any power in the military? No, of course not. But the military gets to topple our governments at will!"\n\nTakahiro sipped his tea quietly as Asahi launched into a full-fledged rant about the situation. He had a feeling it wasn't just Asahi. He was aware that others felt the same way. He knew deep down that people didn't just feel this way here. He was aware that people were ranting about it in tea stalls, shops, and homes across the country..."
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.5.A: "This will not sit well with the people."

 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.6.t: "The Devil's Patron"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.6.d: "As he sipped his tea, Kinmochi could feel a light breeze on his face. Outside, he could hear birds chirping and the dull sound of people conversing somewhere far away. Unlike his own state of mind, it was quite peaceful outside.\n\nHe had made the decision to name Senjurō Hayashi as the next Prime Minister. Despite his initial reservations, he'd grown increasingly convinced that Hayashi was the right choice. Still, he was uneasy about handing power to a right-winger.\n\nA voice interrupted his train of thought, "Honourable Genrō." Hayashi had arrived and was now respectfully bowing before him.\n"General Hayashi." Kinmochi returned a small bow with a smile. "I assume you already know why I called you here?"\n"Certainly, sir. I gratefully accept your nomination and pledge to perform my duties to the best of my ability."\n"Well, then, good luck." Kinmochi closed his eyes and returned to his tea.\n\nKinmochi's abrupt resolution of the conversation did not go unnoticed by Hayashi. But he didn't care. In any case, the whole thing was a formality. As Hayashi walked away, the gravity of the situation became clear to him. He could feel the power of the position in his hands, as well as the weight of the position's responsibility on his shoulders.\n\nHe had ambitious plans for Japan. He could now work on making them a reality."
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.6.A: "We shall see how it goes."

 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.7.t: "Tie-up Finance"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.7.d: "The Hayashi administration has finally announced the approval of a new budget after days of negotiations.\n\nThis new budget prioritizes the nation's armed forces and military production capabilities. It is a weaker but more effective substitute for the budget proposed by former Finance Minister Eiichi Baba. The budget also collaborates with local businesses and influential corporate organizations to improve the nation's military standing.\n\nPolitical observers have hailed this as the start of a "new era of military-business cooperation." With increased monetary flow into the military, Japan's armed forces are expected to soon be on par, if not outrank, those of the Western Powers. Some experts have also stated that this is a "warning to those seeking to exploit Japan," stating that "Japan is on the rise, and our destiny will be realised soon."\n\nHowever, some experts have taken a different stance on the issue. They see increased military revenue as evidence that Japan is drifting further away from democracy. They warn of an impending military takeover, either peacefully or violently. They argue that military investments should instead be directed toward the civilian sector in order to strengthen the economy and raise people's living standards.\n\nDespite the fact that opposing viewpoints have emerged, it appears that this budget will be regarded as one of the Hayashi administration's greatest achievements. As one of our government sources pointed out, "Only the voices of the military and businesses are important. They support it, so we have unanimous support.""
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.7.A: "Let's hope this doesn't backfire."

 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.8.t: "Businesses React Positively"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.8.d: "The Hayashi Cabinet has gained popularity as businesses have declared their support for and approval of the new budget's implementation.\n\nWhile it was fully expected that businessmen with close ties to the government would support this budget, given their role in its creation, the reactions of more neutral and isolated corporations remained uncertain. The Hayashi Government was concerned about the lack of clarity in this matter because they couldn't move forward with their plans until they received and evaluated the reactions of the businessmen. However, it appears that the cloud of uncertainty surrounding this matter has lifted.\n\nAnonymous corporate sources have stated that, while they continue to oppose the increased emphasis on the military, they are unable to argue with the results. "If cooperation with the military is what it takes to bring prosperity and wealth to Japan, then we are absolutely willing to do so," one commentator said.\n\nNow that the business community has backed their plans, the Hayashi Cabinet can move forward with their reforms. While there is no doubt that their intentions are to strengthen Japan, the outcomes of their actions remain uncertain."
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.8.A: "A great victory for Hayashi's Government."

 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.9.t: "The Diet's Quiet Fury"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.9.d: ""Well, what about our economic plans?" Hayashi questioned the man who claimed to be a "conservative representative."\n"We will also not support that. I'm afraid you will not have us with you in your infrastructure plans as well," the man sneered.\n\nThe cabinet members murmured to one another. Hayashi clenched his fist. "I see you're not going to back any of my cabinet's initiatives. Why not?"\n"Officially because we believe these will cause an economic downturn. But privately..." the man explained as he approached Hayashi, "it's because you've taken away our corporate supporters."\n"But-"\n"There is nothing more to say, Prime Minister. I shall take my leave now."\n\nAs the man left the room, the cabinet members' chatter became more audible.\n"It's fine," Hayashi said, trying to persuade himself more than the cabinet members. "I am confident that the conservatives' obstinacy will be irrelevant as long as we have the support of the Diet."\n\n"Prime Minister, we do not believe the Diet will back us up."\nHayashi could feel his blood beginning to boil. "Why the hell not?" he exclaimed, taking a deep breath.\n"Perhaps we should ask the Diet members here," said another cabinet member in response to the question. He took a look around sarcastically. "Oh, no, they don't exist. How do you expect the Diet to support you when you won't even tell them what our reasoning and plans are?"\nMany of them agreed with a slight nod.\n"In that case, gentlemen, please allow me some time to think," he said, politely asking them to leave.\n\nHayashi assessed his situation. With both the conservatives and the Diet opposed to him, something needed to be done about them...."
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.9.A: "We will have to deal with them immediately."

 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.10.t: "Hayashi Calls Elections!"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.10.d: "As he read the reports, Hayashi's fingers tightened and his lips trembled. Infrastructure projects were abandoned. Economic plans were in disarray. Industrial projects had not even begun. Hayashi turned red as he read through paper after paper detailing his cabinet's failures. In a rage, he screamed and threw away the papers.\n\n"The damn conservatives and imbeciles in the Diet are proving to be a huge impediment," he grumbled to himself. "I have to do something about them."\n\nBut what could he do? Persuade them? It was too late for that. Bribe the members? He couldn't afford it. Propose other reforms? No other reforms were as effective as these.\n\nHe was irritated by his situation. He was the Prime Minister, and the Diet had brought him to heel. He, who had been appointed by the Emperor to lead Japan, was being thwarted by petty politics and self-serving politicians. The entire Diet was completely corrupt. None of its members could see beyond their respective political parties. Political parties had divided everyone and prevented any progress from being made. The problem was the Diet, not its members.\n\nAn idea came rushing to him, as if an angel from above whispered it into his ears: Dissolve the Diet.\n\nHe was well aware that he was taking a risk. Some would call it reckless. However, dissolving the diet would give him the time he needed to plan his reforms. The conservatives would be avoided. Most importantly, it would result in the formation of a one-party state. A state free of petty politics.\n\nHe knew exactly what he had to do."
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.10.A: "The Diet shall remain no longer. Call the elections!"

 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.11.t: "Dashing in Shame"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.11.d: "Hayashi tried his best to focus on his breathing. For the past fifteen minutes, he had been trying to meditate with little success.\n\nAs he took a deep breath, he said, "Inner peace." But he knew his thoughts begged to differ. How could he focus on his breathing when there was an election choking him by the throat? How could he try to stay calm when the results of this election would change the destiny of Japan? How could he try to meditate when he and the nation were in a period of immense turmoil?\n\n'Maybe some water will calm me down', he thought as he grabbed a nearby cup of water and took a sip. The cold water seemed to alleviate some of the discomfort.\n\nOne of Hayashi's aides came running into the room. Out of breath, he said, "Sir, the election has been concluded."\nHayashi's grip on the cup tightened. "And?" he nearly screamed.\n"Sir, it appears...." the aide hesitated, partly to catch his breath and partly because the news he bore was not exactly positive. "It appears we have lost."\n\nHayashi could feel the pressure on his throat transform into a sinking feeling in his stomach. He could feel the cup slipping from his hands and falling to the ground, shattering into a thousand pieces, much like his dreams for a strong Japan.\n\nHis gamble had failed. His plans were destroyed. His position was lost. Now, all he could do was to submit his resignation and leave with honour."
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.11.A: "\"Very well.\""

 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.12.t: "The Child of Fate"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.12.d: "Kinmochi could see a glimmer of happiness in Konoe's eyes. Smiling ever so slightly, he said to his protégé, "Konoe, it brings me great pride and happiness to inform you that you have been chosen as the next Prime Minister. Are you willing to accept this position?"\nKonoe smiled, "Of course, great Genrō. I humbly accept your appointment, and promise to carry out my responsibilities to the best of my ability."\n\nKinmochi replied, "You will always have my blessings, my child. All that is left for me to do is to wish you luck and send you on your way."\nKonoe bowed. "Yes, sir. I will take my leave now."\n\nKinmochi calmly observed Konoe leave the room. After several weeks of political unrest, his protégé now held the highest government position. Kinmochi was confident in his selection this time after the failures of his prior nominees. He found solace in the knowledge that he could be certain Konoe acted according to his principles and would do so even in his capacity as prime minister.\n\nOne idea steadily emerged in Kinmochi's head, however, as he thought back on the other occasions. It gradually took over all of his thoughts, like a weed he couldn't get rid of. He pondered, "What if Konoe had planned this from the start? What if Hayashi was only for him a means to an end? What if he elects to serve as Prime Minister and adopts his right wing beliefs?"\n\nKinmochi no longer felt at ease."
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.12.A: "Only time will tell if Konoe was the right choice."

 JAP_Abe_Cabinet.1.d: "Nobuyuki Abe was exhausted. The international situation has been complicating his work in Foreign Affairs for several days now. He is finally ready to go home after hours of hard work when a young soldier walks into his office.\n\n“Yes, what do you want?”\n“General Nobuyuki, I have been sent here to announce you as the new Prime Minister!”\n“Excuse me, what? What happened to Hiranuma Kiichirō?”\n“He has resigned.”\n“And I was suggested to succeed him? But why?”\n“The Army probably thought you were a good choice, sir.”\n\nAfter a few minutes to prepare himself, Abe finally went with the soldier to the government building. Sadly, he will probably not be able to rest tonight.\n\nAfter a few conversations with those he knew there, he learns that he has been appointed for a few reasons: another candidate for the ministry, Ugaki Kazushige, was hospitalised, and, after a few debates, it was agreed that Abe was a good compromise candidate: he is neutral towards army factions, he has good experiences from his post in foreign affairs, and, finally, he is relatively moderate.\n\nAbe sighed as he settled into his new office."
 JAP_Abe_Cabinet.1.A: "Let’s get to work"

 JAP_Abe_Cabinet.2.t: "A Fresh Face"
 JAP_Abe_Cabinet.2.d: "General Nibuyuki Abe has been appointed the 37th Prime Minister of the Japanese Empire following his nomination. The man was chosen for this position because of his known neutrality between the army's factions, the Tōseiha and the Kōdōha, or the Militarist and Imperial factions. The fact that he has never belonged to either of those two factions is good news because he can communicate with both without offending either, and he cannot be accused of favouritism when dealing with them.\n\nAbe is also unique in that the Navy supports him because of his political moderation: he has no great ambitions for power and will most likely not be a threat to the militarists. Finally, his experience as a Foreign Minister will benefit him because he understands the global political situation, and he will most likely try to form new alliances with Japan's ideological allies, possibly even ending the war in China.\n\nDespite these positives, a number of Army senior officers do not respect him because of his lack of combat experience, and we are concerned that they will not be of much assistance to him when he needs it."

 JAP_Abe_Cabinet.3.d: "Japan has been at war with Asia for many years. Japanese enemies are hidden and ready to attack everywhere, including Russia and China. However, in order to fight the war, the country requires armament, oil, ships, and aviation, all of which come at a high cost to our economy.\n\nPrime Minister Nobuyuki Abe proposed a solution to this complicated situation a few days ago. He specifically requested that we experiment with integrated trade practises, claiming that their use will greatly benefit us if we want to buy material from foreign powers. In fact, aligning our prices with theirs could be a great idea, combining both an improvement in relations with potential trade partners and fewer difficulties in finding appropriate equipment. It could also prevent price escalation in the event of a war stalemate, and price stability is the bare minimum we need to win in the end.\n\nAbe is waiting for his collaborators' responses after presenting his idea to the assembly for thirty minutes.

Additionally, the enormous amount of mineral resources scattered throughout the island, such as iron, lead, copper, aluminium, gold and nickel, are now under the direct supervision of the Australian Government-General, with local mining companies now required to employ our people, and trade exclusively with the member countries of the Co-Prosperity Sphere at advantageous prices.\n\nOur ultimate goal is to achieve minzoku kyōwa - racial harmony, with all people, regardless of their nationality, ethnicity or race, cooperating as equal citizens in a single society, but for the time being, His Majesty’s former subjects will receive certain benefits and privileges in order to further incentivise settlement and immigration.

 JAP_226_Events.5.t: "The Greater East Asian \"Film Sphere\" "
 JAP_226_Events.5.d: "An ideological offspring of the GEACPS, the Greater East Asian Film Sphere is difficult to define. Essentially, its purpose is to completely remove the corrosive Western influences found in our society and eventually produce films that would represent a pure, “Oriental” spirit. Contrary to what the name might suggest however, only Japanese films are to be used, for practical reasons, as it is no surprise that the motion picture industry is severely lacking in our fellow East Asian neighbours, and it would take significant time and effort to foster. Using what already exists is far easier than creating something from scratch.\n\nHowever, the most important reason for using only Japanese films is best explained by our leading film critic, the venerable Iijima Tadashi, who states that the cinematic output present in other regions of East Asia "consists of elements that are at once foreign and domestic", and in conclusion damaging to the Sphere’s goal of eradicating Western imperialism in the region.\n\nMany of the potential films proposed by our filmmakers have China as the subject, a prime example of the sickening effects corruption, stagnation and Western influence can have on a nation. Contrasting with China's continued traditionalism are “Vow in the Desert” and “Green Earth”, two films produced by the Film Sphere that will be put on the big screen. These movies epitomise our ideals, with themes such as modernisation, progress and patriotism prevalent throughout. A keen audience might even notice that the solution to the conflict between traditionalism and modernisation is in plain sight: the Empire of Japan, now the technological leader of Asia and the rightful successor to the historical glory of China, capable of bringing them a new age, one of prosperity and happiness."

 JAP_226_Events.7.d: "Finally, it is time for the people of Asia to truly stand together in the face of Western imperialism. A conference of the member states in the Co-Prosperity Sphere will be held by us over a two day time span. What remains to be decided is what the conference itself will be about.\n\nThe obvious option would be to dedicate the conference to the ideal that we have espoused for the past decade, that of Pan-Asianism. Ever since its inception, the idea of a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, where all the Asian peoples would live together as brothers and sisters, was the main driving factor behind our ability to rally the various peoples of the region under our leadership. Continuing to use this recipe for success is only rational. Speeches by representatives from our neighbours, encouraging the Asian people to rally behind us against the European devils will be a sure success.\n\nHeartfelt speeches are indeed pivotal for the morale and unity of our Sphere, but what good are these when we lack the resources to back them up? Will the Pan-Asian ideal matter when soldiers of the West march upon the streets of Asia’s great cities, our warriors unable to stop their advance, our planes and ships too few to secure the air and sea around them? We have been unable to develop our forces to their full potential due to a chronic lack of resources, and as such, appealing to our “friends” for material assistance is another choice we could make. They will indubitably, even if begrudgingly, bow to our wishes.\n\nAnd, of course, there is always the option of this gathering being simply a way for us to reinforce the “commitment” of our fellow members to their leader, the Empire of Japan. You can never go wrong when you make sure the cogs of a machine are working as intended."

UNAUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTION SHALL MERIT DISCIPLINARY ACTION.\n\nTo: Mutō Nobuyoshi, Commander of the Kantō-gun\n\nFrom: Commander of the Shanhaiguan Garrison\n\nSubject: Preliminary Checks Completed, Nekka Sakusen Is Operational\n\nSir, \n\nFirst stage of the operation is now ready to proceed. Our forces have already fabricated the casus belli necessary with flying colours, having been able to create enough tension along the Chinese border for a justified military response. \n\nAs expected, command in Tokyo has not issued a response over the matter, but are not likely to intervene in these state of affairs or be forced to take action, much like in the //REDACTED// Incident, a few years past.\n\nSoldiers on the ground are ready and prepared for the expected Chinese response. We urge your swift issuance of the final ultimatum, so to exert maximum pressure on the adversaries."
 JAP_Nekka_Incident.1.A: "The divine Kanto-Gun shall crush the Chinese, send the letter."
 JAP_Nekka_Incident.2.t: "The Kanto-Gun's Latest Ultimatum"
 JAP_Nekka_Incident.2.d: "RECIEVED FROM [REDACTED] WITHIN KANTO-GUN DIVISION, EMPLACED ON MANCHURIAN BORDER:\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nThe act perpetrated by the Northeastern Army yesterday morn, is an unacceptable act on many fronts. They have violated the national sovereignty of the State of Manchuria without due cause, have harassed, intimidated, and even attacked soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army without any cause whatsoever, and have caused irreparable damage to the fragile peace in the region. \n\nWe of the Empire of Japan, whose sole duty is the protection of the State of Manchuria's sovereignty, now see the Northeastern Army, and by extension the Republic of China, as fervent warmongerers who have no restraint in violating Manchuria's sovereignty and independence.\n\nAs such, we hereby demand the cessation of hostilities along the Shanhaiguan sector of the Manchurian-ROC border. The Northeastern Army's 626th Regiment and all other troops of the Northeastern Army are to hereby evacuate from the area swiftly and with haste. \n\nFailure to concede to our demands will result in a military response by the Empire of Japan.\n\nDo not test our resolve.\n\nOFFICER STATES LETTER WAS DELIVERED TO CHINESE FORCES ACROSS THE DMZ. KANTO-GUN DIVISIONS HAVE SEIZED CONTROL OF VILLAGES AND TOWNS ALONG THE BORDER."

While we faithfully protest these ludicrous and outrageous demands, we cannot deny that a direct military conflict will endanger the fragile peace that current exists between our two nations.\n\nAs such, we will comply with the demands, as ludicrous as they are. All RoC troops will be evacuated from Shanhai Pass, including the Northeastern Army, who will withdraw from the border region. We hope that this preserves the peace and calmness remains between our two nations."
 JAP_Nekka_Incident.3.A: "What luck the Kwantung has."
 JAP_Nekka_Incident.4.t: "The Northeastern Army Stands Their Ground!"
 JAP_Nekka_Incident.4.d: "FINAL RESPONSE FROM CHINESE FORCES ACROSS DMZ\n\nWe have received the demands that Japan has asked of our nation, and we have come to the conclusion that these demands are outrageous at best and a grave insult at worst. This is Chinese soil, owned and controlled by the people of China and the Northeastern Army. We needn't listen to a foreign power on how to govern our state of affairs. Better yet, why should a foreign power dictate our very own sovereignty?\n\nAs such, we wholeheartedly refuse the demands imposed to us. We remind you, we are a sovereign nation with international support. It is in the interests of both of our countries that you heed and respect our response, forthright."

UNAUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTION SHALL MERIT DISCIPLINARY ACTION.\n\nTo: Mutō Nobuyoshi, Commander of the Kanto-gun\n\nSubject: AAR - Shanhai Pass Operations Secured\n\nAfter the immediate refusal by the Chinese, we requested the IJA 8th Division to secure the Shanhai Pass, consisting of armored trains and tanks, along with significant Imperial air support. The IJN's 2nd Fleet bombarded strategic positions along the immediate coastline, to great effect. \n\nThis combined arms approached created an extremely chaotic situation for the garrison of Shanhaiguan, where the Great Wall of China meets the sea. Combined with inferior technological capability and better training in the Kanto-Gun, the battle became a bloodbath. NEA commander Shi Shian was forced to abandon the wall itself and evacuate south, only after the slaughter of half of his 40,000 troops.\n\nWith this victory in hand, it is safe to say that the first stage of Nekka Sakusen is a resounding success. At your approval, we can finally initialize the second and final stage of the battleplan - an invasion of Rehe."
 JAP_Nekka_Incident.5.A: "Excellent! Prepare the trains, we will move hastily."
 JAP_Nekka_Incident.6.t: "A Manchurian Rehe"
 JAP_Nekka_Incident.6.d: "IMPT:  DOCUMENT IS FOR KANTŌ-GUN OFFICERS ONLY. UNAUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTION SHALL MERIT DISCIPLINARY ACTION.\n\nRehe is a region that, to the naked eye, seems useless to fight for. Sure, we could say that its one less territory off the Chinese vermin, and another victory for the Toku Heidan. No no, to fully understand it's value, we mustn't look at the pragmatism but on the symbolisms.\n\nRehe has context, a Manchurian context. It was a haven for the gentry and noble, most especially the Manchu Emperors, who stayed every summer in the Mountain Resort palace, a place where the Emperors could escape the political theatre of the Middle Kingdom. Of course, this was during the time when Emperors were revered in China, and not the tainted and misguided ideology of Republicanism that exists today.\n\nRehe now is just one of many territories the Nanking government \"controls,\" a land of banditry and anarchy with puny governors who are merely just warlords in disguise. As such, it is morally and symbolically right to retake Rehe for the Manchu people. \n\nThere are many ways to approach this. General Tang Yulin - the so-called Chairman of the Rehe Government - could be influenced if we invited him for a meeting. Or as is known, direct military action has served us well."
 JAP_Nekka_Incident.6.A: "Invite the General, he may be useful to our cause, diplomatically."
 JAP_Nekka_Incident.6.B: "Forgo the meeting, seize the border towns. Let us proceed with next steps."
 JAP_Nekka_Incident.7.t: "The Deal with Yulin"
 JAP_Nekka_Incident.7.d: "Tang Yulin - Chairman of the Rehe Government and one of many warlords who rule the region. Originally a general of the Fengtian Clique, he was appointed to govern Rehe, along with the 12th Fengtian Army. Once Chairman Chiang's armies started knocking at his door however, he was able to secure his position - becoming Chairman under the banner of the Kuomintang. \n\nMuch like every warlord, he has had his fair share of corruption and misuse of authority. His frequent usage of extortion and exorbitant taxes have allowed him to rule, much more akin to a Kingpin than a Governor. Not to mention his insatiable lust for the criminal underworld, using it as a conduit for illegal wealth through the Treaty Ports, selling opium, antiques, and other luxury goods and property, to his most favorite clients, the Italians. One would think he would be open to any negotiation. \n\nHowever, despite his criminal nature, it seems General Yulin has a nationalist side. After being offered riches beyond his wildest dreams, and a permanent rule over Rehe, he has refused every offer we have handed to him. An unfortunate setback, but no matter. The General, along with the entire Northeastern Army, will be destroyed and all his riches shall become ours."
 JAP_Nekka_Incident.7.A: "A grave insult, and one that will be punished!"
 JAP_Nekka_Incident.8.t: "The Kanto-Gun seeks...approval?"
 JAP_Nekka_Incident.8.d: "\"...upon which the cities of Chaoyang and Kailu shall be taken in the initial stages, with the 4th Cavalry Brigade taking Chifeng and, along with the 1st Special Tank Company, take Chengde. We expect minimal resistance from the local Chinese forces, considering their equipment is inferior in nature, with only a handful of heavy weaponry in hand and with very limited ammunition.\"\n\nThose were the words of the Kanto-Gun representative presenting the \"strategic operation\" plan to Hirohito. Seems that our previous protests against the last incursion have brought the Army officials to Toyko, seeking Imperial approval. However, Hirohito knows the military, with their thirst of conquest and their vengeance against the Chinese, will not stop at Rehe. The Emperor knows better - carte blanche to the militarists effectively signs off any hope for civilian rule. Instead, Showa plays his ace.\n\n\"General, the operation is approved.\" \n\n\"There is only one thing I ask of you - do not, under any circumstance, go beyond the Great Wall.\" \n\n\"The destruction of this Chinese symbol will surely guarantee further bloodshed and will paint us as warmongers among international circles. Invade Rehe and finish this needless war, but not a step more.\"\n\nStunned, the officer bowed. \"I will give you every assurance that your request will be honored.\"\n\nThe soldier continues his walk through the gates and outside the Imperial Palace. As he walks down the blocks, and into history, he pulls out a map and begins to draw..."

 JAP_Nekka_Incident.9.d: "IMPT:  DOCUMENT IS FOR KANTŌ-GUN OFFICERS ONLY. UNAUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTION SHALL MERIT DISCIPLINARY ACTION.\n\nTo: Mutō Nobuyoshi, Commander of the Kantō-gun\n\nSubject: Great Wall of China, subdued.\n\nSir,\n\nImmediately after approval by His Majesty The Emperor, our troops along with the 4th Cavalry Brigade and the 1st Special Tank Company took over and occupied the strategic cities of Chaoyang, Kailu, Chifeng, and Chengde with minimal resistance. Although the Northeastern Army was at a steep disadvantage, they did attempt to combat our forces, with minimal to no success.\n\nIncluded in this package is a picture of the moment our forces breached and captured the Northern Great Wall of China. It is a glorious day to have captured such a symbol as this. Although intelligence states that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek will deploy additional forces to the National Revolutionary Army, we have profoundly concluded that they will be unable to dislodge our current defenses.\n\nWith Nekka Sakusen a total success, it is my advice we best start negotiations with the Chinese. While our power is great, failure to negotiate and end the ongoing incident may invite international powers into the conflict, likely to try and gain their own share of China. Furthermore, while stable, our supply lines are long and time is needed to shore up our new territory."

 JAP_Nekka_Incident.10.t: "Kanto-Gun Overruns the Great Wall!"
 JAP_Nekka_Incident.10.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Stunning news just released by the Imperial General Headquarters (IGH) today, as the IJA and the IJN have released details of the seemingly unknown Operation Nekka.\n\nA two-stage plan that involves taking the strategic Manchurian territories of Rehe and the Great Wall, it seems that the operation has been a great success. Minimal losses of life from our own soldiers, while heavy casualties upon the Chinese forces, have only bolstered spirits.\n\nStating the superiority of Japanese weaponry and military doctrine, this is a historical moment in Japan's quest to liberate Asia from the imperial powers and their corrupt and traitorous collaborators. As Japanese soldiers march across the cities of Chengde, Chaoyang, Kailu, and other cities in the territories, they are often greeted by the local Manchu populace, celebrating their liberation and unification with their fellow Manchu brethren in the State of Manchuria.\n\nThis is a glorious day for Japan, one of many that shall come!"

 # Tanggu Truce
 JAP_Tanggu_Truce.1.t: "A Meeting in Tientsin"
 JAP_Tanggu_Truce.1.d: "Tientsin, the city that never sleeps. Ever since the days of Unequal Treaties and Gunboat Diplomacy, the city of Tientsin was considered the gateway of Northern China to the outside world. Everything from antiquities, porcelain, even narcotics, all go through cities like Tientsin before they are injected into the Chinese market or the global economy. Of course, we are not blinded by such an opportunity.\n\nMuch like the West, the Empire has set up its own sphere of influence within the city, using it as a means for economic advancement and, if necessary, subverting the Republic from within. The treaty ports have become a haven for both conglomerates, Kempeitai personnel, and mere prospectors looking to gain wealth and gain within greater China. However, today, it serves a different purpose entirely.\n\nOne of the many perks of a Treaty Port is it's inherent neutrality, considering the many stakeholders that are often at odds with one another. With this diplomatic standing, we can easily negotiate with the Chinese, without fearing any form of intervention or unexpected outcomes between both parties. Perhaps it is time that we meet with the Nanking government, and finally put an end to these trangressions, once and for all."
 JAP_Tanggu_Truce.1.A: "Treaty diplomacy is still our objective."
 JAP_Tanggu_Truce.2.t: "The Issue of Manchuria"
 JAP_Tanggu_Truce.2.d: "Manchuria, the new lifeline of the Empire, and the most contentious subject of negotiations. The blood spilt on foreign lands was all because of this breadbaskest of Northern China, whose economic potential is profound and of great interest for Nippon. Politicians, Bureaucrats, Militarists - all see the great beauty that can be cultivated for Japan, with its vast amounts of raw materials and nearly limitless supply of cheap labor.\n\nAs such, we cannot compromise on this issue. No form of negotiation or alternative option can defeat the great Manchurian issue. Our only and final demand is this - Recognize the sovereignty of the State of Manchuria, and cease all claims within the region. Manchuria is a client state of Japan, and subverting its sovereignty is, in turn, subverting the sovereignty of Nippon...\n\n...and will be treated as such."

Of course, that is assuming that we are directly bordering them, with their troops stationed at the border, ready to attack should tensions escalate. Remove the troops however, and the border states are free real estate for us.\n\nAs such, another demand shall be presented to the Chinese delegation - a 100 kilometer DMZ extending south of the Great Wall from Beiping to Tientsin, with the Great Wall itself under our control. Japanese aircraft and military units are allowed to enter the area as a form of treaty enforcement, and a law enforcement agency called the \"Demilitarized Zone Peace Preservation Corps\" shall serve as the peacekeepers of the region."

 JAP_Tanggu_Truce.4.d: "Despite our best efforts to liberate lands from the yolks of banditry, savagery, and human corruption, there are still people who cling to their old traditions or simply despise us, seeing us as conquerors who are to enslave their territory. That is the basic definition of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies - men blinded by the past that they cannot look towards a brighter future or people who despise a superior force than they are. These bandits have been a mild annoyance, especially in pacification operations, for they are more armed and slightly better trained than other bandits.\n\nAs such, we shall include a rather secret clause into the agreement - the newly created Peace Preservation Corps must be comprised of personnel not affiliated with the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies in any shape or manner. If found to have affiliations, they are to be terminated from their position."

Coined by the negotiators as the \"Tanggu Truce\", we have gained ownership of a vast new region with limitless economic opportunities and have finally gained the mandate to civilize these lawless lands and cleanse it of banditry and savagery.\n\nIt is a historic moment for the people of Nippon, for we have shown the world that the Asian Dragon has slipped from its pedestal, with the Rising Sun destined to become the guiding hand that shall make Asia bloom into a paradise for the world!

 JAP_Pan_Asianism.5.t: "Tōa Shin Chitsujo"  #For Japan
 JAP_Pan_Asianism.5.d: "On November 3rd, Emperor Meiji’s birthday, Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe announced a seemingly new course in the Empire’s foreign policy. The Tōa Shin Chitsujo, meaning “New Order in East Asia”, is to become the Chrysanthemum Throne’s new direction in regards to its Asian "partners", the purported scope being the total liberation of the oppressed people in this corner of the World from the greed and neglect inflicted by the European colonial powers.\n\nThese newly liberated people, from China to Java, would be free to pursue their hopes, aspirations, self-determination, and prosperity in a fair and peaceful manner with complete "Sovereign" authority over themselves.\n\nThis Pan-Asiatic concept has received considerable support from the populace of the Empire. After all, it is the duty of the people of Yamato to show those lacking the civility, sophistication, and will that the Emperor imbibes us with.\n\nBehind the idealism, however, lie those who see an opportunity for Japan.\n\nMany politicians and nationalists would like to see the “unshackled” territories and people of East Asia, with their resources and capital, be used to further the ascendancy of the Rising Sun on the global stage through the utilisation of their "economic and diplomatic worth". The militarists, likewise, covet the people and materials of the region, but for fuelling the ever-growing war machine, and all the conflicts that are certain to follow it.\n\nAs such, it comes as no surprise that, in the halls of power, the New Order is slowly, but surely, transforming. For the Land of the Rising Sun is the heart of a free Asia, and its needs are the Continent’s needs, whether the people inhabiting it see it that way or not."

 JAP_Pan_Asianism.10.d: "While existing in other forms and different names for several years already, the idea of a “Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere”, formally announced by the Foreign Minister in a press interview, is a far more immediate and concrete reality.\n\nIn light of the recent and continuous destabilization of the Old Continent, the Western Imperialists, along with their hold over their colonies in East Asia, have been greatly weakened. This has allowed us to take a far bolder and active stance on the subject of Asian liberation and self-determination, even to the point of conflict.\n\nThe oppressed people of Việt, Indonesia, and countless other Asian lands will finally be able to proudly state their heritage, national identity and fully express their national aspirations.\n\nThe Empire of Japan, as the foremost economic and military power of the region, will obviously lead the free people of Asia towards everlasting glory and prosperity. For that to happen, however, sacrifices must be made. The Sphere must act as the collective for the mutual benefits of all of its Asian members, with the Home Islands deserving the largest "benefits", appropriate to its position in this International framework. Since ours is the only force capable of challenging the Europeans, to us will most of the iron, aluminum, tungsten, and all manners of strategic goods be transported, because only we have the requisite industrial capacity to process and utilise them effectively. Japanese oversight is, then, after all, will be quite indispensable in all military affairs of our Asian "partners".\n\nPerhaps a time will come in the future when they will be capable of determining their own fate, but for now, the Emperor and his loyal subjects will guide the helpless people of East Asia into a new age."

Known as the Hirota Sangensoku, or the Three Principles by Hirota, the speech outlines three conditions for a possible foundation of cooperation between the two countries. This includes the Republic of China making a goodwill policy towards Japan, recognition and approval of Manchuria, and cooperation against Communism in outer Mongolia.\n\nThe speech is considered a high point in Hirota's career, as the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister have approved of the speech. Before becoming the Foreign Minister in 1933, Hirota was both an ambassador to the Soviet Union and the Netherlands. With world-wide recognition, the Minster could be looking to play a bigger part in the government.\n\nThe Republic of China has so far been "disappointed" by the three points, calling them one-sided towards Japan.

 # Trautmann
 JAP_Trautmann.1.t: "Germany Offers Mediation"
 JAP_Trautmann.1.d: "An interesting proposal has come in from across Eurasia today as Germany has offered to negotiate a peace settlement between China and ourselves.The idea has seemingly originated from one Oskar Trautmann, the German ambassador to China, and was quickly endorsed by the German government. Since the 1920s, Germany has had a close relationship with the government of the Republic of China, led by the Kuomintang. After the Nazi Party took power, Germany maintained its good relationship with the Chinese government, but also increasingly began courting us as well. Germany's expectation has been for Japan to be an eastern counterweight against the Soviet Union, a role we are not necessarily so welcoming of. For Germany, it seems, any armed conflict between China and Japan is very unwelcome.\n\nThough we have no current plans to invade the Soviet Union, the fact remains that the Soviets exist as an existential threat to not only ourselves, but all nations in Asia. Our war with China is just and important, however, if we were able to put this conflict on hold with some concessions for ourselves in the meantime, it would strengthen us while giving us time to prepare for a second offensive into China or to defend against possible Soviet incursion if they take issue with our actions in East Asia.\n\nWe’ll gauge China's receptiveness to such a proposal by tentatively accepting Germany’s proposal with some territorial demands for Japan. The decision now is how we ask to take in these negotiations. Asking for too much might collapse talks, but too little and there may not be enough gain to justify our expenditure in this war."

 JAP_Trautmann.2.t: "China Defers Their Response"
 JAP_Trautmann.2.d: "China’s response to the proposal for talks have been rather muted. While they initially responded positively to the idea of pursuing a ceasefire, since our terms have been delivered to them, movement on the proposal in Nanjing has been almost nonexistent. Our diplomats in China, those who worked with the German ambassador to China, Oskar Trautmann, have reported that they believe the Chinese are hesitant to commit to peace talks or even just ceasefire talks right now. They further stated that it was their belief that the Chinese might be waiting for some major victories on their part to strengthen their hand in the negotiations against us and our demands. Whatever the case, talks have stalled."

When push comes to shove, the Chinese simply do not have the moral fiber or strength to resist our expansion. At this rate, Japan will conquer all China piecemeal. While the gains acquired were not necessarily everything we wanted, the time granted to us with the ceasefire will allow us to prepare a new offensive even more potent than before.\n\nIn the meantime, China’s decision to acquiesce to our demands will surely put the Chinese government in hot water not only with their own people, but with the various warlords remaining as well. Such action could very well fracture China’s relative unity against us.\n\nRegardless, our position has been strengthened, even if there are those in government who argue that believe concessions gained were insufficient to compensate for the expenditure of manpower and resources pursuing the previous offensive into China. These naysayers will surely be proven wrong when fresh Japanese troops surge across the border into the heartlands of China in a year's time."

The gains achieved for Japan were significant, and will take out a significant portion of China’s productive capacity out of commission while allowing ourselves to consolidate our occupation administration in the region.\n\nIn the meantime, China’s decision to acquiesce to our admittedly significant demands could put the Chinese government in danger. Not only will they have lost legitimacy with their own people, but with the various warlords remaining as well. Such an action could very well fracture China’s relative unity against us, and more Chinese disunity is always a boon for us.\n\nRegardless, our relative position has been strengthened significantly. While there were naysayers who advocated against these talks, our major success in acquiring new territory from China will surely put them in their place. And, of course, when we inevitably return to our conflict in China, the Chinese will be powerless to stem the tide of fresh troops and armoured divisions that follow."

 # The Rivalries of War

 JAP_Rivalries_of_War.1.t: "Stirrings in the Kwangtung"
 JAP_Rivalries_of_War.1.d: "The army is the sword and shield of every nation, as any good soldier knows. Soldiers know that they are vital to pursue any foreign policy goals. Without them, our country would be subject to foreign domination and invasion. Thus, the army must receive the support it needs to continue acting as the guardian of the Empire. Yet, as of late, it seems that politicians in Tokyo no longer adhere to this way of thinking.\n\nIncreasingly, soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army have taken note of the shoddiness of their own equipment. Meanwhile, the Imperial Japanese Navy comes out with newer and ever-larger ships year after year. Army transports on the ground are hardly given enough fuel to get from point A to B, while the navy is sending their vessels across the Pacific and back regularly.\n\nSoldiers and officers alike have even begun to openly question this apparent favoritism on the part of the current administration, some even fielding questionable and potentially even treasonous solutions to this issue. Failure to address these concerns could lead to some adverse consequences in the future. "
 JAP_Rivalries_of_War.1.A: "Troubling."

 JAP_Rivalries_of_War.2.t: "Anger in the Navy"
 JAP_Rivalries_of_War.2.d: "Japan has always had a heavily maritime-influenced culture: the Japanese diet consists mostly of seafood, and our biggest cities are on the coast. But most pivotally, our strongest line of defense against the outside world has been the ocean which separates us from the Eurasian mainland. However, as technology has advanced, the naval capabilities of our rivals and other antagonizing forces have only increased, necessitating the development of a large navy of our own.\n\nWithout this navy, there can be no Japan. The homeland cannot be protected, our commerce secured, nor our foreign policy goals attained. Despite this, politicians in Tokyo have continued to pursue a policy of favoring the army over the navy. Funds dedicated to securing our waters are going towards ensuring that army Generals have a large enough salary instead.\n\nSailors and naval officers alike have taken to open criticisms of the current regime, some of which is potentially treasonous in nature. While such talk is not yet quite so urgent, if this situation is not meaningfully addressed, at some point, it could evolve into something significantly more dangerous."

 JAP_Rivalries_of_War.3.t: "Kwangtung Soldiers Mutiny!"
 JAP_Rivalries_of_War.3.d: "Relations between the Kwantung Army and the Japanese government have for some time been deteriorating. However, today these tensions rose to a boiling point as several Japanese battalions mutinied within the Kwantung Army. Citing a failure on the government’s part to account for the Army’s needs as a form of gross negligence, the battalions have completely ceased obeying commands on the front lines.\n\nA series of demands have been relayed to us concerning the long running disputes between the Navy and Army, which demands increased funding, regime change, more of a say in government, among other things. Clearly, ceding to all of these demands would be impossible, not to mention cripplingly destabilizing for Japan.\n\nThat said, if we don’t address at least some of these grievances on the part of the Army, more battalions likely will follow in the mutineers footsteps. The situation has already gotten and is continuing to get seriously dangerous. If we wish to continue having an army loyal to Japan, action must be taken now."

 JAP_Rivalries_of_War.4.t: "A Case of \"Lost\" Orders"
 JAP_Rivalries_of_War.4.d: "The ability of an army to fight and carry out the objectives of war is influenced by how rapidly they can carry out the orders they were given. Our military must be able to quickly move and obey orders to operate effectively on the battlefield. Worryingly, however, our army has seen an increasing failure to respond to directives immediately.\n\nOrders to march or advance upon objectives are conveniently “lost”, or when they arrive, all sorts of excuses come back for why progress is slower than expected. Most commonly, arguments center around either the lack of equipment and food or the quality therein. Some of these excuses have reached ridiculous extremes, with one battalion commander even arguing that his unit could not move unless they received higher-quality boots.\n\nThese borderline insubordinate actions are likely caused by the growing enmity between the army and government in Tokyo, with many soldiers and officers holding favoritism for the IJN. We should address this situation before their behavior gets worse. "

 JAP_Rivalries_of_War.5.t: "Interservice Fistfights"
 JAP_Rivalries_of_War.5.d: "As the enmity between the Army and Navy has grown in recent months, so has the violence between these two groups. Groups of army soldiers have been harassing sailors in portside bars and instigating fights, as have large groups of sailors in towns near army bases. While most of the participants in these fights have come out more or less alright, a few had serious injuries.\n\nMost of these incidents have been swept quickly under the rug with minor punishments for the involved parties. However, as these incidents have increased in frequency, so has their notoriety. The government would prefer not to have this interservice rivalry spill into public life, or worse, god forbid, for the public to get involved in this discourse.\n\nThe current stopgap solution has been to require officer supervision at all times while in uniform, including at bars and other popular locations where the two parties could meet. However, as the officers themselves become more involved in this rivalry, this solution may become ineffective. Ultimately, we should hope to begin mending this rivalry before the situation deteriorates any further. "

As of late, though, more and more ships and crews are failing in these training exercises.\n\nMany of these crews are slow and lazy to carry out orders given, being wholly unenthusiastic about the whole affair, so we cannot field them against a serious opponent. It seems that we have managed to counteract this with increased disciplinary action from above in case of failure, encouraging said crews to work harder at improving their skills. However, it also seems to be building a sort of resentment towards the current administration. Compounded with support from the admirals, many of whom are upset over the IJN’s seemingly reduced political power in government, the sailors have committed to ever more treasonous talk.\n\nAs long as this imbalance of power and funding exists between the Army and Navy, we will see resentment and drawbacks build. We should work to alleviate these feelings on the part of our sailors before the situation gets worse. "

Admirals ignoring orders, ships unable to do the simplest of naval formations, and a highly resentful naval command and sailor population. As the navy currently stands, it is not well equipped for warfare against another significant naval power.\n\nIt is very likely that the root cause of this issue is the great tension that has accumulated between our army and navy military branches over the past few years. Many within the navy, both high up and rank and file believe that the army is getting preferential treatment over the navy, receiving more funding and more of a say in government and war planning. The reaction to this for some has been in part a general sense of apathy towards their duties, not training well or performing as exceptionally as they should. For others, however, their reaction has been downright radical or treasonous, some even floating talks of armed resistance or a coup.\n\nThis state of affairs must be resolved, and preferably in a timely manner. Allowing these rogue elements to fester within our ranks is dangerous for everyone, and the more resentment that builds between the army and navy, the more powerful such elements will become."

These enemies have one thing Japan desperately needs: Natural resources. The Japanese Empire lacks these critical and necessary materials at the home front to do anything from manufacturing to construction to war production. Much planning has taken place, and there are places to expand further in the north.\n\nOur first target was Manchuria. A good start, seeing that Manchuria has an abundance of resources and the Chinese government’s precarious control made it vulnerable to us. Using an incident, we sent the IJA there and briefly conquered the region in a short time. A real success it is, and a start to something bigger. Secondly, we can expand from Manchuria to Mongolia. Mongolia has plenty of resources, and establishing control over there would give us a wider array and a wider front to invade China or Russia from it.\n\nAnd then there are the Soviets. They inhabit the vastness and richness of Siberia, and are at our door. We‘ll wage a great struggle against Bolshevism if we have to, and if we invade the Far East, the natural wealth and resources will be the grand reward. Our reward after finally ending Bolshevism. But, Russia may be too vast and too big to defeat and this in itself may make our plans backfire.\n\nOn the other hand, we could look towards the south of Japan and see the western colonies and China. The Dutch East Indies contain an abundance of oil and rubber, being very plentiful in resources, along with China almost being just as vast and rich, but divided internally by warlords. We can utilize this by invading China to have a gateway to the Indonesian riches, but this would come at a severe cost of rewriting entire plans that took so long to prepare."

This region doesn't have oil or rubber, but the abundance of steel, aluminium, and any resource similar allows us to wield the material to build and further develop weapons of war. But Manchuria is a stepping stone to something greater: The Dutch East Indies.\n\nIt’s no wonder why the Europeans colonized the places they did: They’re usually rich in rubber and oil. But there are a few obstacles in our way. The first one is China. China lies between French Indochina and our puppet state in Manchuria, and China’s ambition would eventually pose a threat to our rule in Manchuria. The second one is the Western Powers themselves, but who cares about them? What can they do but watch?\n\nIf we have secured our rule over China, or at least, a part of it, we can move our eyes towards the real reward: Indonesia. Our forces will land first in Indochina via sea and maybe land if possible. After consolidating control in Indochina military-wise, we strike key points in Indonesia with naval landings, while the cooperation from the air force and military facilitate air-to-ground support and paratrooper landings. Should we be successful, we would be a step closer to Japanese dominance over our enemies and possibly East-Asia.\n\nAnother route is Siberia and Mongolia. Controlled by the Soviet Union, these resources would be better suited under the banner of the Rising Sun, rather than in the accursed hands of the godless Bolsheviks!\n\n...But we’ll have to redraw plans and that will be a huge hassle with an severe cost."

Because of its importance as a trade hub, the Imperial High Command declared Magadan to be a point of "great strategic importance" that should be captured as soon as possible, both to significantly weaken Soviet access to the Pacific and to secure our supply lines for further advances into Siberia.\n\nTo ensure that Magadan can continue to serve as the main logistical hub for our war against the Soviets, it is critical that the port and its facilities remain operational and free of Soviet sabotage, which would render an assault over land and subsequent siege of the city impossible.\n\nThe Imperial Navy has thus proposed a plan for an amphibious attack against the city, which will secure control over the town with minimal damage to the port and low casualties.\n\nThe plan calls for a Special Marine Landing Force to attack the port at night, overrun the outmanned garrison, and then secure and reinforce the port against enemy counterattacks. Meanwhile, the Navy would begin shelling Magadan's interior to disrupt Soviet counterattacks, while reinforcements would land in the port to relieve the Marines and conquer the rest of the city. The Army will provide additional support by attacking in other frontal sectors, tying down Soviet reserves, while our Air Force will provide cover for the invasion force."

 JAP_Panay_Incident.3.t: "Roosevelt Declares War on Japan"
 JAP_Panay_Incident.3.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Following the Panay Incident, the sinking of the USS Panay by a Japanese bombing attack, the United States have officially declared war on the Empire of Japan and are therefore joining China in their war effort against Japan. The declaration was formulated an hour after a speech given by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, where he formally requested the declaration. The declaration was quickly brought to a vote, with it first passing the Senate and then the House. Several Congress members and outspoken pacifists, as well as the American ambassador to Japan, Joseph C. Grew, have voiced their concerns, worried that this will send many young Americans to their death and are questioning if they are really prepared for a war on this scale.\n\nThe official text of the declaration states the following:\nJOINT RESOLUTION Declaring that a state of war exists between the Imperial Government of Japan and the Government and the people of the United States and making provisions to prosecute the same. Whereas the Imperial Government of Japan has committed unprovoked acts of war against the Government and the people of the United States of America: Therefore be it Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the state of war between the United States and the Imperial Government of Japan which has thus been thrust upon the United States is hereby formally declared; and the President is hereby authorized and directed to employ the entire naval and military forces of the United States and the resources of the Government to carry on war against the Imperial Government of Japan; and, to bring the conflict to a successful termination, all the resources of the country are hereby pledged by the Congress of the United States.\n\nThis aggressive reaction could turn the tide in the second Sino-Japanese war, and change the future of Asia forever."
 JAP_Panay_Incident.3.A: "The Giant has awoken."

 JAP_Panay_Incident.4.t: "The United States Joins Us in Our Struggle!"
 JAP_Panay_Incident.4.d: "The American ambassador, Nelson T. Johnson, has brought us very good news. Following the destruction of the USS Panay by a Japanese bombing attack, the United States has decided to declare war on Japan and assist us in finally defeating the warmonger Hirohito. Given how the war has not progressed in our favour, with the loss of key cities across our nation, this assistance is much appreciated and could provide us with the forces we require to turn the tide of this war. All we have to do now is hold the line until American forces arrive, at which point we can launch a counteroffensive, driving the Japanese out of our homeland and reclaiming our lost cities.\n\nThe Japanese most likely believed that the war would be over soon. Now we'll show them that the war is just getting started. We will take their cities as they have taken ours. Along with our American allies, we will march to Tokyo and pay Emperor Hirohito a visit to demonstrate the Dragon's might."
 JAP_Panay_Incident.4.A: "The Dragon and the Eagle, brothers in arms."

 JAP_Panay_Incident.5.t: "The Giant Awakens"
 JAP_Panay_Incident.5.d: "The public is scared, our soldiers are worried and government officials are panicking. The United States has officially declared war on us, and we are not ready to fight the forces of both the United States and China.\n\nAlthough our war in China has been relatively successful thus far, the sinking of the USS Panay may be remembered as one of the biggest mistakes in our country's history, given how this mistake may have doomed the Japanese Empire. We would have gone to war with the US anyway, but this war came much sooner than we would have liked, and we are unprepared. While we expected a reaction from the US, few anticipated such an aggressive response.\n\nAll we can do now is fight to the death, mobilise the entire Imperial Japanese Navy, and hope that it will be enough to push the Eagle back on one side and finish off the Dragon on the other. If we can accomplish this, we may still have a chance to win this war. If not, and the Japanese Empire is doomed to fall, so be it. But we will not give up without a fight, and our spirits will not be broken because the Emperor, a divine being, is still with us. Banzai, Tennheika!"

 JAP_Panay_Incident.6.t: "Ambassador Crew Demands an Apology!"
 JAP_Panay_Incident.6.d: "Joseph C. Grew, the American ambassador, has approached us with demands from Washington, D.C. that we are to issue an official apology for the Panay Incident and accept full responsibility for the events that occurred.\n\nMany in our government advise us to give in to the demands and issue an apology in order to avoid angering the Giant, as we are still engaged in a war with China and cannot afford further escalation. If we do not deliver an apology, the sleeping Giant's response is uncertain, with the worst-case scenario being the severance of diplomatic ties and a war on two fronts; a war for which we are not yet prepared.\n\nOn the other hand, an apology could make us appear weak on the international stage, as if we are cowering before the US, which our enemies and future enemies, both internal and external, could exploit.\n\nWhatever we decide, we must be cautious and deliberate in our next steps, as this decision will shape the future of the Japanese Empire and our relations with the United States."
 JAP_Panay_Incident.6.A: "We will issue an official apology"
 JAP_Panay_Incident.6.B: "Japan? At fault? Preposterous!"

 JAP_Panay_Incident.7.t: "Ambassador Sugiyama Apologizes"
 JAP_Panay_Incident.7.d: "We have received an answer from Tokyo, regarding our demand that they issue an official apology. Japan has decided to give in to our demands and assigned Vice Admiral Rokuzo Sugiyama, Chief of Staff of the IJN 3rd Fleet, to make an apology. In this apology it is stated that their pilots never saw any American flags on the Panay. Furthermore, they admit that one navy plane launched a machine gun attack on a boat and that Japanese army motor boats launched attacks on Chinese steamers escaping upstream on the opposite bank. They, however, maintain that the attack was unintentional. Finally, they apologise for the accident and hope that Japan and the United States can maintain good relations.\n\nOur ambassador to Japan, Joseph C. Grew, and several other government officials are relieved that this crisis was able to be resolved diplomatically, and they commend us for remaining calm and resolving the situation diplomatically. Some, however, believe that we were too soft and that the victims of the Panay Incident were not properly avenged. Furthermore, some believe that the incident was planned and that it will only be a matter of time before Japan declares war on us, arguing that we should have taken advantage of the opportunity and attacked Japan while they were busy with the Chinese.\n\nOnly time will tell if we have made the right decision, but for now this crisis is over and ended in a victory for the United States."
 JAP_Panay_Incident.7.A: "Then the matter is settled"

 JAP_Panay_Incident.8.t: "Silence from Tokyo"
 JAP_Panay_Incident.8.d: "We have now been waiting for Japan to respond to our request that they issue an official apology for the Panay Incident for some time. Our request appears to have been ignored, and we will not receive an apology from Tokyo. The Japanese, it appears, are not interested in resolving this crisis diplomatically, preferring to have bad relations and sever diplomatic ties rather than apologise.\n\nEven though we did not receive the apology we desired, this does provide us with information about Japan's intentions and future plans. They clearly do not want to work with us, so we must brace ourselves for the inevitable. Our Pacific islands are now more vulnerable than ever, as this is most likely just the beginning of a large-scale conflict with the Japanese Empire. Unless Japan sends an apology, we can expect more conflict and, eventually, a full-fledged war. A war for which we must prepare.\n\nClearly, our citizens are outraged, believing that the government is incompetent and has failed to properly resolve this crisis, and they are demanding vengeance for the innocent lives lost in the Panay Incident. The Japanese may have avoided punishment for the time being, but..."

 JAP_Oil_Embargo.1.t: "Japanese Ambitions in Indochina"
 JAP_Oil_Embargo.1.d: "Mr. President, we have received information confirming that the Japanese Empire is currently occupying the entire former French colony of Indochina.\n\nChinese forces have been importing supplies from the French through Indochina to aid them in their war against Japan. As such, the Empire of the Rising Sun initiated negotiations with the government in Vichy. They demanded naval basing rights, control over airbases, the right to transit troops, and the closure of the border with China. Although in the end, the French accepted the demands, Japanese soldiers slipped out of control and conflict broke out.\n\nAfter a few days, they regained authority over their troops. The result of the incident was the Japanese occupation of Northern Indochina. The Southern part only seized recently, likely in preparation for a potential invasion of Indonesia. Although all of French Indochina is now under Japanese supervision, the colonial soldiers and civil administration were allowed to remain.\n\nIt is now apparent, the Empire of the Rising Sun has no limits. They will continue to cause bloodshed throughout Asia until someone stops them. More and more people in our cabinet suggest we place an oil embargo on Japan. Such a sanction would certainly cripple their war effort, as they import most of their fuel from the States. With this, we may stop their warmongering without any of our soldiers having to die. It must also be pointed out, Mr. President, that they undoubtedly won't take this too kindly, we should be prepared for armed retaliation."

 JAP_Oil_Embargo.2.t: "The United States Retaliates!"
 JAP_Oil_Embargo.2.d: "The United States of America has imposed an oil embargo in retaliation for our recent liberation of Indochina.\n\nThis isn't the first time the US has punished us: they've already stopped selling us scrap metal and cut us off from the Panama Canal. Despite the fact that a lack of metal hampered our war production, we continued on with our great crusade. However, these sanctions pale in comparison to the oil embargo.\n\nFuel was our most crucial import from the US, as such, the importance of this sanction cannot be understated. Without it, our machines of liberation cannot run for long. We desperately have to find another source of oil as soon as possible.\n\nWhile the prosperous Dutch East Indies seem promising, the Navy is certain that any attempts to seize it would bring the USA into the war. In the end, we are left with two choices: acquire Indonesia before our reserves run out or submit to the Americans."

British bases were also hit, indicating that the Japanese Empire will also be at war with The British Empire.\n\nThe operation was made in two waves, the first wave was to be the primary attack, while the second wave was to attack carriers as its first objective and cruisers as its second, with battleships as the third target. Although there are few accounts, it is estimated that up to 2,400 sailors died and another 1,000 wounded. Important base installations such as the power station, dry dock, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building were not attacked.\n\nIt is unclear how the United States was uninformed of this attack but on this day marks the United States of America entry into the Second World War on the side of the Allies.

Since the Boxer Rebellion, the IJA has maintained a small garrison in Shanhaiguan, which holds a position of great strategic importance, as the most valuable pass of the Great Wall, right on the historical border with the Manchurians. And to the south of Shanhaiguan lies Rehe, barely held by one of the many corrupt and rotten bandits that lord over Chinese provinces as if they were kings. \n \nUtilising the same methods used in the Manchurian Incident, plans are being set regarding the usage of false-flag tactics to seize Shanhaiguan completely for Manchuria, and to release Rehe from the ever-weakening grasp of Zhang Xueliang. Surely, if our plans were to succeed, we'd placate the Manchurian populace and further cement our indisputable dominance over northern China."

Given the pitiful state of China, being marred in a never-ending civil war against the Communists and the lack of international support, we are in a perfect position to demand the total withdrawal of the remaining Kuomintang border troops, in order to form a demilitarised zone. The Chinese will also acknowledge that Manchuria is a legitimate state, and that Rehe is a core part of it, whether they like it or not. \n \nBesides creating an opportunity for newfound peace in the region, these negotiations will also improve Manchuria's standing in the international sphere, given that the Western powers continue to refuse to acknowledge its sovereignty."

This will allow us to finally see Japan as one culture and nation. Another, more subtle, goal of the Taisei Yokusankai is establishing Japan as a one party state, removing all other affiliations that are harmful to the Kokutai.

To counter this, our finance advisers have given us a draft of a law that could temporarily draw funds from different government funded programs to buy and build new factories to help this deficit.

To the world, that's all we were good for. Then, the Meiji Restoration took hold. Sciences of all kinds flooded into our culture. Railroads, guns, mass production, steam power, and new ways of thinking suddenly came into reach of our \"primitive\" people. Now, due to the movement of the Shōwa Modan, we have as many patents of inventions equal to those of America and Germany. European powers constantly change their governments and ideals to fit the advance of technology. For us, we don't forget what brought us to this point. We adapt the new ways of thinking with the old.

Shamefully, none of the branches of the Japanese military have anything close to resembling them. While the concept had been discussed since the beginning of the decade, the Imperial General Headquarters showed no interest in promoting the pursuit of a paratrooper program.\n\nThe winds are changing, however. As the usefulness of such a unit has become more apparent, the higher echelons have finally approved the establishment of an airborne unit within the Imperial Air Force. Called the Teishin Shudan, meaning ‘Raiding Group’. Light & mobile, these special forces will drop behind enemy lines, be they mountains, forests or jungles, and sow chaos.

A truly glorious moment for the Empire of Japan as a whole, its significance for the direction of the Imperial Japanese Navy is clear to this day.\n\nAs British naval dominance diminishes and the American navy becomes more and more of a threat, the Decisive Battle Doctrine shall prove to be as useful as 30 years ago.

These would allow us to target our enemies from a distance, preserving our already limited resources and negating the numerical superiority of forces such as the US Navy.\n\nWhile very costly to build and maintain, they could prove to be the deciding factor in a future conflict.

To counteract this and ensure maximum effectiveness in the years ahead, we must increase support among the people for the war effort, and guarantee their total commitment to the cause. Government officials have proposed several ways of achieving this. Some advocate for expansive propaganda campaigns, while others float the idea of imprisoning those who show opposition to the war. \n\nHowever, one popular idea that most can agree on is the improvement of the Japanese economy, and therefore, living standards, by increasing the number of factory jobs available. This will of course also have the obvious benefit of supplying our military with a constant stream of quality equipment. After placing our orders for new tanks, airplanes, and guns, we will soon see a massive boost in the Japanese economy and attain the support of those who have had doubts. A long, drawn out conflict still remains an unfavourable scenario, but it will surely be made less devastating with the majority of the populace behind us."

However, with the cabinet and the Prime Minister primarily focused on our war with the westerners, the House of Representatives will serve as a valuable asset in managing the home front and any problems that may arise, and with left-wing and communist candidates prevented from running, this election's results are near-certain, meaning that we will have no issue controlling the house and its decisions."

The lack of a central organisation to properly manage and procure supplies, organise logistics, and manufacture materials is severely limiting our current industrial potential, and it is having a severe knock on effect on the war effort. This is why Prime Minister Hideki Tojo has taken it upon himself to establish the Gunjushō, the Ministry of Munitions.

Whilst production of munitions and other such dealings have seen a moderate increase, it is nowhere near what we can do, and nowhere near what we need. In order to hastily rectify this situation, the newly-proposed Munitions Company Act shall impose a series of measures to increase armaments production by cutting through the red tape on the home front and punish severely any official who finds themselves ignoring their orders.

It was His Majesty himself who appointed him as Prime Minister. His capacity to further the interests of the Rising Sun makes him trustworthy for the position. To deny his will is to disobey the emperor, the highest treason imaginable.\n\nIf they wish to oppose the most loyal of servants, then so be it.

With the exception of the Land of the Rising Sun, every other Asian nation is incapable of matching the European colonial powers.\n\nIn order to circumvent this disadvantage, our sworn allies must give everything they have, be they resources, factories or men, to their liberator and protector, for only the Emperor’s warriors can obtain victory against the devils of the West.

 JAP_The_Fading_Ballot_Box_desc: "Ever since the passage of the Peace Preservation Law of 1925, our grandiose experiment for Eastern Democracy is a mere distant memory, one too old for the people of Nippon to remember. The subversion of the democratic process is seen in all facets of Nippon - from the apathetic populace who are disgusted by the pervasive corruption and politicking, to the military technocrats who strongarm the Diet and other legislative bodies for the sake of preserving the Kokutai (National Polity).\n\nThese factors, along with weakening civilian institutions, has led to the civilian government being increasingly subservient to the whims of the military, along with being unable to control army groups such as the Kwantung Army, whose incursions into Manchuria is a sentiment not shared by Tokyo. As such, the future of the civilian government has been subjected to much speculation, though all signs seem to point unfavorably..."

Seen as protectors of the people who serve the emperor, the military has been the focal point in our victories in Korea and in Russia, defeating our adversaries in a whim. As such, they are often paraded as heroes and saviours to the people, and are often given a respectable amount of prestige that no single individual could ever imagine.\n\nHowever, what was once the protectors of the state, have concluded, to become the state.\n\nEver since the success of the Mukden Incident, the military has taken a rather extreme approach in dealing with politics. Gone are the days when the Civilian government is unilaterally superior than the military establishment. Now, the military dictates the policy directions of Tokyo, either by forcing utmost neutrality in the Cabinet, to even assassinating Prime Ministers if they are seen as a threat to their growing power. Japan's destiny squarely lies on a blade's edge."
