 ### 4th Encirclement Start
 PRC_Fourth_Encirclement.1.t: "4th Counter-Encirclement Campaign"
 PRC_Fourth_Encirclement.1.d: "Today, the long planned Nationalist offensive on our position has finally begun after months of preperation and anticipation. Our spies and scouts have repoted the Nationalists have amassed a force of around 500,000 and outnumber us 7:1. To only make matters worse, they have crushed one of our major bases in Pengxian and now move on our pocket in Jiangxi among others, seeking to elimate us for good. At this moment in time they surround us, and with their numerically superior force, we will have to make up for our weaker military with brilliant strategic planning and tactics. /n/However, there is a conflict within the military affairs committee. Otto Braun and Bo Gu have assured us they can deal with this invasion by launching surprise counter-attacks and by using traditional doctrines, but many of the generals are unsure and deem this risky new strategy unecessary, instead preffering Mao's doctrine of Mobile Warfare, that has so far seen widespread success."

 #Ideas
 PRC_The_Quarantined_State: "The Quarantined State"
 PRC_The_Quarantined_State_desc: "We have been cut off from supplies geographically and politically since the traitorous Generalissimo Chiang turned on us after the Second Northern Expedition. To weather this storm, we must rely on our labour, wit, and ingenuity."

 PRC_Land_Equalisation: "Land Equalisation"
 PRC_Land_Equalisation_desc: "Following the party's investigations into land inequality, our land redistribution policy, pingfen tudi, has put an end to peasant exploitation and returned the means of production to the working masses."

 PRC_Status_of_the_Red_Army: "Status of the Red Army - Emboldened"
 PRC_Status_of_the_Red_Army_desc: "The Red Army is the revolution's sword; like all swords, it must remain sharp and lethal if we are to win this conflict. Despite outnumbering and outgunning us, the Nationalists will never be able to defeat our will."

 PRC_The_New_Soviet_State: "The New Soviet State"
 PRC_The_New_Soviet_State_desc: "Our Soviet Republic, following in the footsteps of the USSR, stands as the pinnacle of revolutionary thought in China. As a result, our struggle is of existential significance. In the coming years, we must look to our ideological benefactors in the Comintern for guidance and inspiration."

 PRC_Conflicted_Military_1: "Conflicting Strategies"
 PRC_Conflicted_Military_1_desc: "Mao Zedong's strategy of Mobile Warfare has been used in the last 3 Encirclement Campaigns to great effect and a lot of our field officers, and tactical experts are well versed in his stratagies and military doctrines. However, the arrival of Bo Gu and the Soviet military advisor Otto Braun has caused a rift to appear on the Military Affairs Committee. Bo Gu, Otto Braun and the 28 Bolsheviks are pushing for a new strategy to be adopted that would favour more traditional doctrines, yet many in the command are reluctant and feel we should still use Mao's Mobile Warfare doctrines to reduce casualties."
 PRC_Conflicted_Military_2: "Conflicting Strategies"
 PRC_Conflicted_Military_2_desc: "Despite the Military Affairs Committee and many of its staff still being torn between the strategies of Otto Braun and Mao Zedong, Mao's stratagy of Mobile Warfare has taken root due to the disasterous effects of Bo Gu's and Otto Braun's stratagems. While many are still reluctant to commit to this old, but effective strategy, these critics are nor much more hesitant to oppose it after our defeats and the implementation of its tactics can begin, without opposition, allowing them to be fully and effectively deployed."
