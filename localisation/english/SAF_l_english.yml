 SAF_1933_General_Elections_held: "§Y1933 General Elections§! have been held\n"
 SAF_National_Party_Victory: "National Party Victory"
 SAF_National_Party_Victory_desc: "From this day and onward the National Party of South Africa will take our country to glory. Under the leadership of the new lead party, the people of South Africa can look forward to many changes in their day to day life as it shall become better and our country shall prosper and become one of the major powers in this world of ours."
 SAF_South_African_Party_Victory: "South African Party Victory"
 SAF_South_African_Party_Victory_desc: "After a rather close race with the National party, the SAP has managed to come ontop. The Afrikaner dominated party has already shown signs to be much more of a mediatory party between the Afrikaner and the British than the National party would otherwise be. Although still Boer centered Jan Smuts seems much more inclined to seek cooperation with the Anglos on equal standing and remain on friendly terms with the Crown and not seek immediate independence or emancipation from it. Among its policies, it also looks to encourage the immigration of European Whites into the continent."
 SAF_Centralize_the_Government: "Centralize the Government"
 SAF_Centralize_the_Government_desc: "Our nation is in a great depression, and to cure this disease we must start with reforming the government. The best decision is the centralization of our government in order to manage the trade with both the Axis and Allies and with that stay neutral in this war, along with administering our territories faster, for we have the final say. Many may see this as an act of cowards but we truly believe we must cooperate with both sides, and then at the end of the war, we shall side with the victor and continue to build up our country."
 SAF_Restore_Relations_with_the_Boers: "Restore Relations with the Boers"
 SAF_Restore_Relations_with_the_Boers_desc: "The bitter and bloody Boer Wars have stained the relationship of the South African state with the dutch-descendant Boer population and made it so that they oppose our every move. This tear of relations with our fellow European brothers has lead to unrest to the resource-rich North West and has diluted the unity of all whites on the continent. A campaign to entice the Boers and show them that their participation is needed and wanted in the formation of this great nation will help us with this issue."
 SAF_Merger_with_the_SAP: "Merger with the SAP"
 SAF_Merger_with_the_SAP_desc: "Our success in the elections doesn’t mean it will happen again, while we have gained the necessary political clout to gain power we suspect that the Anglos will no doubt impede out policymaking at every opportunity. To Prevent this unwanted tug of war we must woo and join forces with the Afrikaaners of the South Africa Party as to form a united political bloc, allowing almost unilateral support for our reforms."
 SAF_Promote_Economic_Autarky: "Promote Economic Autarky"
 SAF_Promote_Economic_Autarky_desc: "A great nation stands on its own two legs without having to rely on anything and anyone to drive itself forward. South Africa has fertile lands and deep ores ready for the taking. To be importing products from the British would only serve to get addicted to sucking on their teat while we have most of what we need ready for the taking and at our feet. Our country will flourish only when it knows how to take advantage of what it has."
 SAF_Increase_Afrikaner_Privileges: "Increase Afrikaner Privileges"
 SAF_Increase_Afrikaner_Privileges_desc: "The Afrikaners have been part of South Africa since its colonization in the 17th century by the Netherlands and the first to tame and civilize the area. We must honour these brave men and women by granting them the rights they deserve above the English and natives and free reign to live as they wish. "
 SAF_Replace_Dutch_with_Afrikaner: "Replace Dutch with Afrikaner"
 SAF_Replace_Dutch_with_Afrikaner_desc: "The time has come to dig in our roots. No more shall we listen to the language of Amsterdam. And so today, South Africa shall replace the Dutch language with Afrikaans, to solidify our control and support with the populace, and deepen our roots to this great continent!\n\nWhilst we may have deep ties with the Dutch, as indeed many of our politicians have Dutch ancestry, yet one of our greatest statesmen, James B. M. Hertzog, has left these roots to die on the vine. This is the start of a new era for South Africa, and it will be the era that South Africa proves itself on the world stage."
 SAF_White_Only_Voting: "White Only Voting"
 SAF_White_Only_Voting_desc: "From this day our country of South Africa shall erase the option of the colored people of South Africa to vote in the upcoming elections. For they are unworthy of having their opinions of who shall lead the country. This decision was made by the highest political position in our country and shall be respected until a change happens. In the next few weeks, the government of South Africa may have their hands full of problems or shall this issue be solved by peace. We shall see how the black population of South Africa reacts."
 SAF_Establish_the_Department_of_Social_Welfare: "Establish the Department of Social Welfare"
 SAF_Grants_for_the_Old_and_Disabled: "Grants for the Old and Disabled"
 SAF_Grants_for_the_Old_and_Disabled_desc: "The future is built on the present and the present shall become the past. We must never forget the sacrifices our fathers and grandfathers have made for us, those who have given their blood, their limbs and even their bodies for the nations and those who toiled endlessly and tirelessly to build this great nation. We mustn’t let our old die in poverty and misery, we must honour them! For honour them is to honour our nation and what is a nation that does not honour its own past?"
 SAF_Representation_of_Natives_Act: "Representation of Natives Act"
 SAF_Representation_of_Natives_Act_desc: "The natives in this country are simply uneducated savages and those who have been taught our ways and hold some wealth will always vote against us but seeing as they’re such an insignificant minority and such a nuisance at the same time nobody will make a peep from either the parliament or the masses if we were to take away their full voting rights. After all, voting is only for citizens, not savages."
 SAF_Reconcile_with_the_States: "Reconcile with the States"
 SAF_Revive_the_Agricultural_Sector: "Revive the Agricultural Sector"
 SAF_Revive_the_Agricultural_Sector_desc: "The periodic droughts of the 1920s followed up by the great stock market crash of 1929 have left our farmers in tatters. While our fledgling industry is still in its infancy many of the people living here counted on farming to sustain their livelihoods but as a result of the aforementioned crash that has lead to a massive spike in our poverty rates. The Parliament has proposed a series or bills and acts that foresee government subsidies for white farmers’ crops coupled with an increase of tariffs until the market returns to normal."
 SAF_Revive_the_Agricultural_Sector_tt: "The §YDying Agricultural Industry§! idea Stability reduction will be modified by §G+5%§!"
 SAF_Save_the_Economy: "Save the Economy"
 SAF_Merger_with_the_Nationalists: "Merger with the Nationalists"
 SAF_Merger_with_the_Nationalists_desc: "The results of the elections have been clear with the South African Party gaining a close but well defined upper hand at the polls. With the new government installed it seems that our rival party, the National Party, has found itself in consensus with us on a plethora of issues leading Mr.Smuts to believe that this pointless competition between our parties needs to stop. As such he has put forth a proposal of a merger with the nationalist, a move that would consolidate our voting blocs."
 SAF_Healthcare_Investments: "Healthcare Investments"
 SAF_Healthcare_Investments_desc: "The whole continent of Africa is suffering from diseases cast by the mother nature of Africa. Many nations lack healthcare and many people die from the diseases they get, to avoid this we shall largely invest in healthcare and try our hardest to help our people fight their illness and try to find a cure for the worst of all the diseases. The people will surely approve of this investment and will be happy for the foreseeable future, of course that will happen only if we implement our investments the right way."
 SAF_Encourage_Privatisation: "Encourage Privatisation"
 SAF_Connect_the_Rurals: "Connect the Rurals"
 SAF_Connect_the_Rurals_desc: "Besides the coastal cities and some settlements in the Northeast, the infrastructure in South Africa is largely lacking with vast expanses of land being purely wilderness and the only communication channels being dirt roads. By making an effort to connect the continental part of our country to the coasts it will allow for facilitated access to inner country resources and permit for much more efficient supply lines for our troops."
 SAF_Bring_Natives_into_Factories: "Bring the Natives into the Factories"
 SAF_Bring_Natives_into_Factories_desc: "Our previous stubbornness to work with the natives has impaired our industrial growth, already stretching thin the amount of manpower available to its limits. Thanks to the current administration’s reforms in racial laws we can alleviate this weight by bringing the local Bantus and Khoisans to the assembly floor and by giving them proper training on machine operations which will also allow us to remain competitive on the market."
 SAF_Abolish_Property_Discrimination: "Abolish Property Discrimination"
 SAF_Abolish_Property_Discrimination_desc: "It is the duty and right of all men to participate in the country’s leadership! As the times have moved forward so have the institutions of man, the laws have made us equal before justice and now technology and education have made us equal in knowledge and responsibility of action towards our nation. As such it is only natural that man not be discriminated by what he owns but by what he’s worth as a man."

 SAF_Reform_the_Party: "Reform the Party"
 SAF_United_Party_Victory: "United Party Victory"
 SAF_Appoint_Loyal_Governors: "Appoint Loyal Governors"
 SAF_Suspend_the_Parliament: "Suspend the Parliament"
 SAF_Suspend_the_Parliament_desc: "The current political atmosphere in South Africa is appalling, as it is marred with political squabbling and hegemonic influence by our British overlords. As the Second World War comes into motion, unrest has swept the nation, fuelled by anti-war sentiment and British ultimatums on joining this needless war. To preserve our nation's security, and to restore at least some semblance of political stability, we must suspend parliament.\n\nThis act will merely be temporary, a small stepping stone so to ensure that unrest does not go out of proportion. While the ideals of Democracy are a necessity for the proper functioning of civilian government, we cannot allow extremists to gain a foothold in our government, and allow politicians to exploit this political crisis for their ambitions. South Africa shall stand, but only if drastic action shall prevail."
 SAF_Smuts_takes_Reign: "Smuts takes Reign"
 SAF_Form_the_Herenigde: "Form the Herenigde Nationale"
 SAF_Dreams_of_Independence: "Dreams of Independence"
 SAF_Dreams_of_Independence_desc: "Ever since the integration of our Union into the British empire, there have been a variety of independence movements aiming at creating a South Africa independent from London. While these movements seemingly were seemingly destroyed during the Boer wars, there is still a multitude of people that carry the wish for independence in their hearts. With Britain now occupied in its European affairs and the fear that brave sons of South Africa will once again sacrifice their lives for a foreign war, these times have created the perfect moment for us to realize our lifelong dream.\nThe dream of independence."
 SAF_Contest_British_Rule: "Contest British Rule"
 SAF_Contest_British_Rule_desc: "For too long, our British overlords have enjoyed unchecked power and luxury at the expense of our people. They have dictated our domestic and foreign policy without context nor consideration of our people, as long as it was in line with London's interests and theirs alone. They claim to give us "Dominion" status, that we are free to decide our fate as a nation, yet the British remain adamant in empowering their entrusted Governor-General, funding Pro-British political parties, and pressure our government to crackdown in anti-imperialist sentiments.\n\n It is time that we take a stand and dissolve our relationship with our colonial masters. The people of South Africa can no longer allow the British oligarchs to maintain a monopoly over our affairs, both big and small. If they shall resist, so be it. Their time has ended, no more, no less."
 SAF_Proclaim_the_South_African_Republic: "Proclaim the South African Republic"
 SAF_Proclaim_the_South_African_Republic_desc: "The time has come to throw off the chains of British oppression and imperialism that have been on us since their conquest and colonization of the Boer Republics in the last century. We will not be dragged around by the Anglo collar around our neck not in culture, politics, much less into a new World War!"
 SAF_Integrate_the_Protectorates: "Integrate the Protectorates"
 SAF_Integrate_the_Protectorates_desc: "Our country uses a rather bureaucratic and inefficient system in governing some of our territories - the Protectorate system. This system allows a rather charitable amount of autonomy to some territories while benefiting from our protection and being under our sovereignty. While it has worked in the past, it has led to inefficiency and has prevented our government to effectively exercise authority throughout the country. It is time that we get rid of this system, and integrate all protectorates into the formal South African state."
 SAF_Claim_Bechuanaland_and_South_Rhodesia: "Claim Bechuanaland and South Rhodesia"
 SAF_Empower_the_Broederbond: "Empower the Broederbond"
 SAF_Empower_the_Broederbond_desc: "The Broederbond, a secret organization created by Boers that has had great influence through South African politics since its inception as the Jong Zuid Afrika, it has been a centerpiece of our nation’s politics for many years. With our nation’s recent turns away from Britain and their sphere, we must wrest the culture and politics away from Anglophones and Anglophiles. They have already been the locus of the political direction of the nation, with many of those who are members the most influential members of the society, why not make it official?"
 SAF_Ban_Natives_from_the_Army: "Ban Natives from the Army"
 SAF_Ban_Natives_from_the_Army_desc: "Any fighting that needs doing will be done by European descendant men and only them. To allow the destructive power of modern weaponry combined with the cunning tactics of modern warfare to uneducated savages would spell doom for all of our nation. No black will ever hold a weapon against a European thanks to us."
 SAF_Recognise_German_Namibians: "Recognise German Namibians"
 SAF_Recognise_German_Namibians_desc: "Once Germany controlled Namibia and many Germans settled in the region, but after the Great War, the region was annexed into South Africa. In order to pursue greater relations with the German nation, we ought to recognize them as their own people and give them autonomy" 
 SAF_Establish_the_Sauer_Commission: "Establish the Sauer Commission"
 SAF_Stay_Inline_with_the_Statute_of_Westminster: "Stay Inline with the Statute of Westminster"
 SAF_Stay_Inline_with_the_Statute_of_Westminster_desc: "The English have offered us a great deal of much sought after freedom with the late introduction of the Statute of Westminster, now we truly hold the power to decide our own future. But to stary too far from them would only alienate and isolate us on the world stage. As a sign of appreciation and for the sake of our own interests we should heed to stay close to the Crown for the time being."
 SAF_Moving_Past_Neutrality: "Moving Past Neutrality"
 SAF_Divert_Resources_into_the_War: "Divert Resources into the War"
 SAF_Divert_Resources_into_the_War_desc: "While South Africa has already shown in the Great War that we are a true friend to our allies in Europe and don't shy away from contributing in the fighting where we are needed, this new war will require us to do our part once again. To accomplish this goal, the High Command, supported by the government and our Friends in London, has drawn up a plan, which will see us divert a sizable amount of resources, normally reserved for the Free market, towards a variety of factories, which have been deemed vital for the war effort."
 SAF_Handle_the_Ossewabrandwag: "Handle the Ossewabrandwag"
 SAF_Handle_the_Ossewabrandwag_desc: "We have turned a blind eye on the OB organization's activities for far too long. We're a country at war and despite being a democracy we can't allow for the nurture and growth of an entire social collective of enemy fraternizers and potential saboteurs right under our noses. Starting today all of the organizations' headquarters will be shut down and everyone that persists in spreading their mantra shall be considered an outlaw."
 SAF_Coordinated_Planning: "Coordinated Planning"
 SAF_Crackdown_on_Ultranationalism: "Crackdown on Ultranationalism"
 SAF_Crackdown_on_Ultranationalism_desc: " In order to prevent our Union from falling to political instability and pointless bickering in this great time of conflict, it is of utmost importance to suppress any movement that might threaten the harmony in South Africa. Both the Boer and Native Independence movements have been a thorn in our side for far too long. We will arrest their leaders, seize their assets and property, threaten anyone who dares associate with them with social expulsion and disperse their organization into the wind, so that no political extremist, whether it be a communist native or a fascist Boer might threaten to stab the war effort into the back."
 SAF_Draw_up_the_Native_Military_Corps: "Draw up the Native Military Corps"

 SAF_Fortify_the_Cape_and_the_North: "Fortify the Cape and the North"
 SAF_Restore_the_Cape_Qualified_Franchise: "Restore the Cape Qualified Franchise"
 SAF_Restore_the_Cape_Qualified_Franchise_desc: "The ardent desire to keep out the non-Afrikaaner and Anglo races outside of the electorate has made sure to create an elite of people that control the destiny of the entirety of the country, but this elite is so restricted and small the efficiency at which we can get things done is quite high but makes the disenfranchised become restless. To drive forward this country we ought to remove all barriers a massive percentile of the people of South Africa have to face in order to have their voice heard."
 SAF_Closer_ties_to_the_Commonwealth: "Closer ties to the Commonwealth"
 SAF_Closer_ties_to_the_Commonwealth_desc: "The decision had to be made, it was between the Axis or the Commonwealth. We have agreed as a strong and free nation that closer ties to the Commonwealth will make our country prosper and achieve all future goals. From this day onwards our focuses shall be set on the Commonwealth and only the Commonwealth. Dealing with the Axis powers is now in the past."
 SAF_Export_Arms_and_Volunteers: "Export Arms and Volunteers"
 SAF_Export_Arms_and_Volunteers_desc: "South Africa, whilst a dominion of the United Kingdom, has always been ready to fight for what’s right, whether or not our masters have wished that so. Many times before we have had to sit on the sidelines watching people suffer, watching the boot of the oppressor come down on the innocent man. But that is no more.\nIt is a new age for South Africa, for we shall finally fight for freedom, wherever and whenever needed. The man who thinks he is ok to bully others into submission shall no longer be tolerated by us. He shall be attacked with such ferocity that no one shall expect it, for he is not aware of the one thing that the average South African has in their blood: Determination. Determination to fight until the end, even if we are cornered like rats, even if the situation is hopeless. But many forget one thing about rats. \nRats can scratch back."
 SAF_Question_of_Federalisation: "Question of Federalisation"
 SAF_Question_of_Federalisation_desc: "Now that the European war has now touched the lives of South Africans, many in the government are wanting for a change. This change pertains to the government itself, and how the country should be run once this bloody war is over and done with.\nSince Westminster brought us into this mess, many want more autonomy and perhaps independence. However, that will require more consideration in due time. That does beckon the question, however; what will ultimately become of the Union of South Africa? Will a more centralized rule be established, or will the Union prevail, albeit more federalized?"
 SAF_Federal_Republic_of_South_Africa: "Federal Republic of South Africa"
 SAF_Centralised_Rule: "Centralised Rule"
 SAF_Repeal_the_Statute_of_Westminister: "Repeal the Statute of Westminister"
 SAF_More_Taxation_of_Segregation: "More Taxation of Segregation"
 SAF_Learn_from_Germany: "Learn from Germany"
 SAF_Learn_from_Germany_desc: "While we have now freed ourselves from the chains of British oppression, it has become time to politically transform our country in order to rid ourselves of the stains that British colonization has left in our political system. And while this process will require us to stand in for ourselves, there is no shame in learning from countries that have mastered similar situations. And what better country to learn from than Germany? Germany under the leadership of Adolf Hitler and the NSDAP has broken free from the chains of both the Treaty of Versailles and the corrupt democracy that has almost destroyed the country, while also mastering the Great Depression-like no other country in Europe.\nAnd if it worked for the Germans, why wouldn't it work for us?"
 SAF_Call_for_a_General_Election: "Call for a General Election"
 SAF_Federal_Union_of_South_Africa: "Federal Union of South Africa"
 SAF_Federal_Union_of_South_Africa_desc: "The answer truly was staring us in the face the whole time. The Union of South Africa is the remains the Union of South Africa. However, this does induce change within our state. Now the parliament will no longer be a unitary, centralized rule, but federal with different sections of South Africa voting for their parliamentary candidate. Hopefully, this will lead to the peaceful resolution of any ill-thought the current government has directed towards it."

 SAF_Appoint_Loyal_State_Governors: "Appoint Loyal State Governors"
 SAF_Fund_Rural_Mechanisation: "Fund Rural Mechanisation"
 SAF_Fund_Rural_Mechanisation_desc: "Our agricultural sector has been severely lagging behind in its production due to still using traditional methods of cultivation resulting in a gap of crop production per acre ratio between us and more advanced countries. This lag is could be mended by introducing mechanized equipment on the fields, however, most of our farmers do not hold many profits to allow for a mass introduction of tractors. A solution proposed in parliament would be to subsidize the introduction of such equipment by lending to farmers the government-owned equipment at low rates or offer to sell them with and overtime payment at low interest for the wealthier ones."
 SAF_Aliens_Registration_Act: "Aliens Registration Act"
 SAF_Aliens_Registration_Act_desc: "While there are a multitude of people and ethnicities in South Africa, currently living in South Africa, it has fallen on the European race to ensure that racial harmony will be maintained in our great Union. Through the registration and racial categorization of all new foreigners arriving in the country, we will mostly be able to separate the different races from one another and be able to prevent race-mixing, which could seriously jeopardize our efforts at maintaining the stability and racial harmony in South Africa."
 SAF_The_Asiatics_Bill: "The Asiatics Bill"
 SAF_The_Asiatics_Bill_desc: "There is currently a major influx of Asiatic people, mainly from China and India, storming into our country. While this is a welcome sight due to the massive amounts of cheap labor these people could provide for us, it has become apparent that the rising number of Asiatics could very well undermine the stability and racial harmony in South Africa. In order to combat any negative outcomes, which might occur, we will pass the Asiatic Registration Act, which will require every Asiatic person to register themselves with their name and a thumb-printed certificate of identity, with every person failing to do this being open for an immediate monetary fine or deportation."
 SAF_Fund_Engineering_Companies: "Fund Engineering Companies"
 SAF_The_Storm_Looms: "The Storm Looms"
 SAF_The_Storm_Looms_desc: "After almost 20 years of peace, it seems like the human desire for war has once again bested any attempts at reason or appeasement. A storm is brewing in Europe and it shall be the biggest upheaval the world has ever seen, Empires will fall, continents will be set ablaze and entire nations will be destroyed. And inside this apocalyptic storm, South Africa will either stand steadfast or be swept aside into the realm of history. Either way, there will be only the option: Fight. Nothing else."
 SAF_Expand_Heavy_Industry: "Expand Heavy Industry"
 SAF_Expand_Heavy_Industry_desc: "While South Africa has already a stable industrial base, it has become apparent in the light of the current situation that it would be wise to further industrialize our country and close the gap to other nations, who currently have a major industrial advantage. We will start this project by expanding our heavy industry by building new factories and subsidizing already existing ones."
 SAF_Metal_Foundries: "Metal Foundries"
 SAF_Metal_Foundries_desc: "The commissioning of additional metal foundries will further turn our economy into a self-sustaining model while also boosting our bellicose capabilities. With the investments into new metallurgic plants, we will be able to construct machines and weapons that will save flesh and blood."
 SAF_Nationalise_Foreign_Arms_Companies: "Nationalise Foreign Arms Companies"
 SAF_Nationalise_Foreign_Arms_Companies_desc: "South Africa has been home for a variety of arms producers from around the world for a good while now, with thousands of weapons made in South Africa seeing Action in almost every conflict this globe has to offer. And while these companies were a welcome sight during peacetime, it has now sadly become a necessity for us to nationalize their factories to bolster our weapon production and to guarantee that South African weapons will end up in South African hands only."
 SAF_Commission_New_Tank_Assemblies: "Commission New Tank Assemblies"
 SAF_Commission_New_Tank_Assemblies_desc: "Whilst South Africa never really has had a stable industry to base itself off of, today is the day where that changes. War in Europe is on the horizon, and South Africa, whilst we are far away, must be ready for the conflict. Therefore, it is in our best interest to open new factories to produce equipment for war.\n\nWhat will be built shall be a mix of rifles, artillery, and trucks, however, these assemblies shall mainly produce tanks, for the Armoured Corps. These tanks would supply our army, and if need be, the United Kingdom and some of our other allies when the time comes. These programs and factories shall turn South Africa into an industrial powerhouse, the likes of which never seen on the African continent!"

 SAF_Build_up_Arms_Stockpiles_desc: "With the coming storm brewing in Europe, many are advocating for a continued build-up of arms. Whilst our army and stockpile are nothing to laugh at, we still need to properly construct a full reserve.\n\n Lee-Enfield rifles have made up the bulk of our stockpile, yet an added number of machine guns, ammunition, artillery and even a few trucks would easily help to increase our reserve monumentally. Buying arms from Britain or other benefactors is our main way of obtaining weapons, our manufacturing industry needs to step up, or we will be caught ill-equipped and under-prepared."

 SAF_The_Economy_Survives_desc: "It seems like the measures enacted by us to combat the recent economic crisis have finally started to show improvements. The stock market has become more stable, the factories are opening again and are already hiring many of the unemployed that the crisis has created, while the public trust in our government has also improved significantly.

 SAF_great_depression: "Great Depression"
 SAF_great_depression_desc: "The Crash of '29 in the United States should've not affected our nation so harshly, if at all. Unfortunately, our dependence on the British economy has brought our economy towards a death spiral. Unemployment, bankruptcy, economic stagnation, all are affecting the nation of South Africa. This has led both the ruling Europeans and the natives equally in suffering, and all are equally calling for swift economic reforms here and now. It is probably best we solve this crisis as soon as possible, or else the entirety of South Africa will finally be equal...in its suffering."

 SAF_dying_agricultural_industry: "Dying Agricultural Industry"
 SAF_dying_agricultural_industry_desc: "Industrial Agriculture, the so-called future of the Agriculture industry. Yet, not here in South Africa. The industrial experiment has failed and is now becoming a dying industry in our economy. It has failed to bring out the desired crop outputs, failed to follow the quotas, and expensive to maintain at its current level. Now, we are at a crossroads. Maintain the current course, and let it fade into the history books, or reform and try to save what remains of our industrial experiment."

 SAF_history_of_segregation: "History of Segregation"
 SAF_history_of_segregation_desc: "As a measure to preserve stability, law, and order, and to ensure the control of Europeans in South Africa, a system of racial segregation has been implemented over the years. These measures, which involve the separation of both the native majority and the ruling minority, has promoted a sort of harmony and national stability, for these prevent any sort of sectarian/ethnic violence which would otherwise undermine the stability of the region. However, this has led to some unintended consequences, as this led to poverty and inequality among the native population, who are angered by such conditions as the ruling class remains in luxury. Should the issue of segregation continue, it could lead to devastating consequences..."

These Afrikaners, who have longed opposed British rule over the region, have now taken a more aggressive approach in ending British rule. The Ossewabrandwag, or the Ox-Wagon Sentinel, have repeatedly engaged in civil unrest, sabotage, subversion of the state, etc. This organization is nothing more but a threat to our rule, and must be dealt with immediately and with extreme prejudice. Most importantly, they must cease to exist before they shake hands with Berlin, else more problems shall arise..."
