 soviet.1.t: "German-Soviet Commercial Agreement"
 soviet.1.d: "It seems that the Germans have need of raw material from Mother Russia. In return for the supply of oil and chromium we are to be granted letters of credit, with which we can buy consumer goods. This will relieve our population's needs for everyday goods, thus strengthening our legitimacy. On the flipside, it will also improve Germany's capacity to produce war material."
 soviet.1.A: "Accept the offer"
 soviet.1.B: "It is too dangerous"

 soviet.2.t: "Commercial Agreement Annulled"
 soviet.2.d: "Our contracting party does not seem so trusthworthy afterall."

 soviet.5.t: "Proposition from Berlin"
 soviet.5.d: "It seems that Berlin has finally come around, and acknowledges our shared duty in spreading the world revolution to all four corners. Combined, Germany and the Soviet Union shall embark on a crusade against the west. It merely requries our pledge of allegiance."
 soviet.5.A: "Let's bury the West"
 soviet.5.B: "We need more time"

 soviet.6.t: "Move Industry to the Urals"
 soviet.6.d: "It would be smart of us to move our industry to the Urals as a war with Germany seems inevitable."
 soviet.6.A: "Agreed"
 soviet.6.B: "Don't be ridiculous"

 SOV_Stalin_Constitution.1.t: "History in One Stroke"
 SOV_Stalin_Constitution.1.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Again our glorious government has moved further in achieving class equality and in furthering the interests of the hardworking workers of the Union in a single stroke, by having adopted a new Constitution.\n\nThe new “Stalin’s” Constitution will be replacing the heavily revised 1924 constitution. The new Constitution has been termed as an unprecedented step for the Soviet people, the Constitution enumerates economic rights not included in constitutions of the so-called Western “Democracies”. It has repealed restrictions on voting, abolishing the “lishentsy” category of people, and has added universal direct suffrage and the right to work. In addition, the new Constitution has recognized collective social and economic rights including the rights to work, rest and leisure, health protection, care in old age and sickness, housing, education, and cultural benefits. The new Constitution also provides for the direct election of all government bodies and their reorganization into a single, uniform system.\n\nOur General Secretary Joseph Stalin, genius of the new world, the wisest man of the epoch, the great leader of communism, has personally chaired over a special commission of 31 members in the creation of this new constitution which has already been enacted by the Congress of Soviets, which itself has been reformed into the Supreme Soviet."
 SOV_Stalin_Constitution.1.A: "Rejoice, Comrades."

 SOV_Repurpose_Naval_Guns.1.t: "Repurpose Old Naval Guns"
 SOV_Repurpose_Naval_Guns.1.d: "The Red Navy has recently submitted a report to the People's Commissariat of Defense of the Soviet Union, highlighting a large surplus of naval guns in the inventory. These guns, though antiquated, can easily be repurposed into land-based heavy guns, suitable for ground combat. Their large-caliber would allow their usage in demolishing enemy strong points and bunkers and can be very useful for the Red Army. And at the same time, their large size and limited mobility would create difficulties for them to keep up with the advancing Red Army. These old guns can at the same time be repurposed into permanently stationary coastal battery emplacements and can be used to create fortress cities and bases, already naval planners have created plans to emplace these guns, with particular plans for Sevastopol, which can easily be turned into an impenetrable fortress."
 SOV_Repurpose_Naval_Guns.1.A: "Repurpose the steel monstrosities into Artillery Pieces."
 SOV_Repurpose_Naval_Guns.1.B: "Repurpose the steel monstrosities into Coastal Batteries."

 SOV_Transpolar_Flight.1.t: "Via the North Pole"
 SOV_Transpolar_Flight.1.t.SOV: "Glory to Stalin's Falcons"
 SOV_Transpolar_Flight.1.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Yesterday, June 20, 1937, a specially outfitted Soviet ANT-25 landed in Vancouver in the United States of America, completing the first-ever transpolar airplane flight. It flew from the Soviet Union to the United States across the North Pole, the aircraft being piloted by our very own falcons - pilot Valery Chkalov, co-pilot Georgy Baidukov, and navigator Alexander Belyakov.\n\nLong and careful preparations were made for the flight, as a forced landing in the Polar Regions would mean certain death for the entire crew, after taking off the first 24 hours of the trans-polar flight proved to be routine and uneventful, but the remainder of the long flight would test the mettle of the Soviet Union’s elite flyers. As the flight neared the Polar Regions, the aircraft’s magnetic compass became inoperable; navigation had to rely solely on dead reckoning and a solar heading indicator, with corrections made by regular sun and star observations. But Despite all the odds, the flight landed at Vancouver's Pearson Airfield successfully after a flight of 63 hours and 16 minutes and were welcomed as heroes.\n\nWhile they do a nation-wide tour of the United States, which includes a meeting with President Roosevelt and a parade in New York City, the people at home desperately await to welcome the heroes."
 SOV_Transpolar_Flight.1.A: "Congrats, to the air pioneers."
 SOV_Transpolar_Flight.1.B: "Congrats, to the air pioneers."

 SOV_Transpolar_Flight.2.t: "The Lost Falcons"
 SOV_Transpolar_Flight.2.d: "Yesterday, we lost contact with Valery Chkalov and his crew of three. They were flying a specially outfitted ANT 25 and were tasked with attempting the world's first-ever transpolar flight. Prior to their unfortunate disappearance, Chkalov reported that all instruments were functioning properly and that his crew was in good condition, which has raised questions about their disappearance. The last sighting of the aircraft was near the 75th parallel.\n\nDue to the highly secretive nature of the mission, Canadian and American authorities were not informed, but there will be no need to tell them now. We have already sent planes into the air to search the area for Chkalov and his crew, however, the chances of finding them are quite low.\n\nTo avoid any trouble, Comrade Stalin has ordered the covering up of all records related to the flight and its fate."
 SOV_Transpolar_Flight.2.A: "Their fate shall be forever shrouded in mystery"

 SOV_COMECON.1.t: "Join the COMECOM"
 SOV_COMECON.1.d: "You should join the COMECON Comrade!"
 SOV_COMECON.1.A: "We shall indeed"
 SOV_COMECON.1.B: "DAMN YOU COMMIES!"

 SOV_Liquidate_The_Church.1.t: "End of the Churches"
 SOV_Liquidate_The_Church.1.d: "The Orthodox Church has wielded considerable influence over the citizenry of our country, this influence especially prevailed during the time of the rotten Tsars, it was greatly reduced after our glorious revolution, but it still continues and persists in large parts of the society.\n\nThe State has decided, in accordance with its official mandate of state atheism or “Gosateizm” to launch a new wave of attacks at the Church, aimed at eliminating or greatly curbing the influence of the Orthodox Church in the Soviet Society.\n\nWe can launch widespread raids, these would include confiscating Church property, deporting the church clergy, and conduct lynchings of the “believers“. This will create some apprehension in the society, on the other hand, a softer and longer but more effective way would be to initiate a cultural program where the tenets of “Socialist Science” will be promoted along with “Gosateizm”, the stigma faced by religious Christians in the society as a whole and in terms of their professional life will in most likelihood commit many to denounce the Orthodox Church, and fully integrate themselves into the Soviet society."
 SOV_Liquidate_The_Church.1.A: "They have subverted the socialist cause long enough, burn their institutions"
 SOV_Liquidate_The_Church.1.B: "A gradual process and change will allow the workers to embrace “Gosateizm” much more extensively."

 SOV_Introduce_Childcare.1.t: "A New Step for Women in the USSR"
 SOV_Introduce_Childcare.1.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Though the Soviet state had established women equal in all spheres and walks of life since the revolution, in reality, due to limited economic independence, their individuality remained dependent on men.\n\nThe state has long looked at women as an untapped labor force, which even the most western countries shy away from. In a bid to strengthen the women and encourage greater participation in the industrialization program sweeping through the country, the state has instituted a massive childcare system, whose facilities will be available to all working mothers at a highly subsidized rate.\n\nThis progressive move has left many foreign commentators in awe, some who have long criticized the Soviet Union as highly repressive have been left speechless, while others are reporting how other countries, especially the “Democratic” ones should take a look at the Soviet system, which has come a long way in combating societal inequalities."
 SOV_Introduce_Childcare.1.A: "We applaude these progressive reforms"
 SOV_Introduce_Childcare.1.B: "An unnecessary upsetting of the social order"
 SOV_Introduce_Childcare.1.C: "A progressive step, perhaps one we should take ourselves"

 SOV_Russification.1.t: "Russification of the USSR"
 SOV_Russification.1.d: "Primus inter pares\n\nOur great nation,the home of the great revolution, consists of several smaller and some larger republics. Despite attempts in the early 20s during the “Korenizatsiya” policy to encourage representation of individuals from each republic in the Soviet system and usage of native languages, the Russians have continued to dominate the Soviet society, and it is clear that they will continue to do so. The Soviet Union needs to become a singular entity and needs to be based around a single culture, the Russian culture, even many in the higher echelons of the party leadership are Russified individuals and native Russians.\n\nThough not officially “superior”, the state directive will be simply that among the equal republics of the great Union, the Russian Republic is “more equal”. With a single language, there would be better functioning of the state, better coordination with local administrations, and in the army, Regional units would be able to coordinate in a more effective manner. A common culture would enable and foster camaraderie between the people, all the way from the workers in Vladivostok to the workers in Baku."
 SOV_Russification.1.A: "Let’s bind the glorious Union with the thread of a single culture."

 #### The Great Purge Failure Events
 SOV_Great_Purge_Failure.1.t: "Now We Know the End..."
 SOV_Great_Purge_Failure.1.d: "The Sun was rising. Stalin took a moment to observe its beauty as its rays began illuminating Moscow. Only has he realized he spent the entire night working in his office.\n\nTired as he was, his eyes couldn't ignore the soldiers marching towards the Kremlin. \"What the hell could they be coming for? The change of guards was several hours ago.\" As Stalin was wondering, more and more armed men were pouring towards him. Two divisions could be filled with that many people.\n\nAs the soldiers were nearing the Kremlin, he recognized the face of a particular one. It was none other than Mikhail Tukhachevsky. \"What on Earth is that bastard doing here? He was supposed to be reassigned to Stalingrad and arrested on the way! That Trotskyite rat must have foreseen the trap! I'll gut him myself!\"\nStalin thought as the sound of shooting disturbed the silence of the early Moscow morning. He reached for the phone instantly: "Voroshilov, where the fuck are you? Fifth columnists are storming the Kremlin!" Only now did he realize the phone lines have been cut.\n\nHis next action was to arm himself with the pistol kept in his desk for special occasions. Instinctively he headed for the safest place in his office, the closet. In an instant, mutineers busted in. One of them opened in on Stalin. His first reaction was to pull the trigger, shooting the soldier in the leg. The other mutineers quickly dragged out the Man of Steel. Once the General Secretary was on the ground beaten and disarmed, Tukhachevsky himself entered the room. The two looked deep into the other's eyes in silence. The once-great leader of the Soviet Union didn't have much to say, neither did the Red Napoleon.\nThe silence was broken by a mutineer rushing into the office, reporting that Voroshilov has been taken care of. \"Well, then there is only one last loose end to tie to complete our revolution.\" Said Tukhachevsky, while giving the sign to the soldier aiming his rifle at Stalin. In an instant, life left Stalin's body."
 SOV_Great_Purge_Failure.1.A: "The Man of Steel now lays on the ground as cold as steel."
 SOV_Great_Purge_Failure.1.A.tt: "General Secretary §YJoseph Stalin§! has been §RKilled§! during the coup.\nPeople's Commissar for Defense §YKliment Voroshilov§! has been §RKilled§! during the coup as well.\nMarshal §YMikhail Tukhachevsky§! has taken over!\n\n§RMoscow is yet not fully secured...§!"

 SOV_Great_Purge_Failure.2.t: "Napoleonchik Pobezhdyon"
 SOV_Great_Purge_Failure.2.d: "Failure. How could it be that the revolution would die in this way? They had been on the cusp of victory. These thoughts quickly flashed through Tukhachevsky’s head, one after another, as he fell backwards towards the marble Kremlin floor. The answer was truly any number of things, from the organization of the putschists to the weapons they had used. For Tuchachevsky’s, however, the blame fell squarely on but one individual, the one whose death might have changed everything. Semyon Budyonny\n\nThe intent had been to storm the Kremlin and the Moscow military district headquarters, kill the Soviet leadership quickly, and then organize for a final battle outside the Kremlin with whatever remaining forces stationed in Moscow. The faster they could decapitate the leadership of the Soviet Union, the faster the coup could be completed. The battle started well enough. The lobby had been quickly secured, and many important offices and their occupants shot up. However, guards stationed throughout the building killed an increasing number of his men as they slogged through the fortified complex. One of the last major military figures they had on their kill list was Budyonnov. If they could kill Budyonnov, there would be nobody left in Moscow to organize local forces against him.\n\nBut the bastard slipped away. Only two of his men managed to slip past the guards who had organized in a last ditch effort to defend Budyonnov’s office, both of whom were caught off guard by the Nagant revolver Budyonnov kept in his office. From there Budyonnov somehow managed to fight his way out, grouping the remaining guards into a small battalion of men that fought their way to the entrance and out to the river, where he met up with the reserve forces of the Moscow Military District.\n\nTuchavesky had fought. He and his men did everything they could to hold off Budyonnov’s newfound forces storming the Kremlin, but it was for naught. Two bullets lodged firmly in his gut as he lay on the floor, Tukhachevsky in his last thoughts reflected that he didn’t feel much of anything now."
 SOV_Great_Purge_Failure.2.A: "A revolution deferred."
 SOV_Great_Purge_Failure.2.A.tt: "The §RTukhachevsky Plot§! has been defeated by Marshal §YSemyon Budyonny§!, albeit at a high cost..."

 SOV_Great_Purge_Failure.3.t: "The Revolution Secured"
 SOV_Great_Purge_Failure.3.d: "Of all the chaos and confusion that has been thrown at us since the days of the October Revolution, it seems that another spanner has been thrown in the works of the hulking machine that is the Soviet Union.\n\nJoseph Stalin, the Man of Steel, our glorious leader, has been slain by ruthless counterrevolutionaries.\n\nAnd not just Stalin, but many of our top officials, such as the NKVD leadership, and even Voroshivlov, one of our top military commanders. So many intelligent and powerful men, taken by the vicious claws of the traitorous Tukhachevsky and his foolish followers.\n\nBut while we may still have tears in our eyes for those we have lost, we must not become distracted from the grave task that is at hand; filling the void that has been left within the ranks of the Politburo. There will be many opportunists waiting for the right time to make their move, so if we are to prevent any further descent into instability, we must act quickly. Thus, the Central Committee has been called for an emergency session in hopes to find a way out of this dark tunnel we find ourselves in.\n\nWhilst we have already decided that Molotov will remain Premier, we still must vote for the crucial role of General Secretary.  There are two frontrunners, with the first being the loyal Stalinist Lazar Kaganovich. He was a close friend of Stalin and choosing him would ensure that we will be able to continue to build on the vision our late leader had for the Union.\n\nAlthough Kaganovich seems like the best choice, the other proposal has been Marshall Semyon Budyonny, who helped put a stop to the threat posed by the counterrevolutionaries. Although not everyone within the Central Committee is sure of the direction he will take our country in, he would be able to provide a great sense of strength and stability, something which the nation is lacking because of recent events.\nWhatever choice we make, it is sure to have great implications for not just the Soviet Union, but for the entire world…"
 SOV_Great_Purge_Failure.3.A: "Only Marshall Budyonny can save the revolution now!"
 SOV_Great_Purge_Failure.3.B: "Comrade Kaganovich will carry the torch of Stalinism forward!"

 SOV_Great_Purge_Failure.4.t: "Stalin Killed in Conspiracy, Red Military Dictatorship Averted"
 SOV_Great_Purge_Failure.4.d.BUDYONNY: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Today is a dark day for the Soviet Union as the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, Joseph Stalin, has been shot and killed by Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky and his men. It is said that the so-called \"Red Napoleon\" and two brigades worth of soldiers loyal to him assaulted the Kremlin and the surrounding areas of Moscow. Eventually, they reached the General Secretary's Office, where Stalin was executed. While Tukhachevsky and Stalin were known to not be on the best terms, due to Tukhachevsky being suspected to have had Trotskyite sympathies, it seems no one in the Soviet Union expected him to go this far.\n\nAfter the death of Stalin and the Minister of Defense Voroshilov, Tukhachevsky and his men attempted to seize the Moscow Military District headquarters. The district's commander Semyon Budyonny resisted and managed to not only defend the headquarters, but also to lead his men to victory as he defeated Tukhachevsky and his co-conspirators in an attack on the Moscow Kremlin.\n\nWith the death of Stalin and Voroshilov, as well as the head of the NKVD and several other party functionaries, the Soviet Union now enters a precarious new age. On the latest gathering of the Central Committee, the Soviet officials elected a new General Secretary. The vacant position will be filled by the hero of these recent events, Marshal Semyon Budyonny. A war hero and a cavalryman to the core, the new leader of the USSR is an unknown variable. How will the Marshal lead the Union?"

 #### The Great Purge Events
 SOV_Great_Purge.1.t: "The Yagoda Proposal"
 SOV_Great_Purge.1.d: "NKVD chief Genrikh Yagoda has submitted to the Politburo, earlier today, a rather controversial proposal. Within he suggests the complete and utter removal of the Trotskyist influence, which still haunts the USSR to this day, via the method of "remote camps". Quite obviously, this has caused outrage from both the Right Opposition and those within the Politburo who still sympathize with the theories of Trotsky. Hard-line communists already appear to be leaning in support of Yagoda's radical plans. Whatever happens, it is clear the party is still open to infighting and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future unless decisive action is taken."
 SOV_Great_Purge.1.A: "We must fend off all threats of the revolution!"

 SOV_Great_Purge.2.t: "Proposal Approved by the Politburo"
 SOV_Great_Purge.2.d: "NKVD chief Genrikh Yagoda submitted a proposal to the Politburo for sending "all the Trotskyists" into the "remote camps"... Under Comrade Stalin’s order, Trotsky was been taken from Power, expelled from the party and exiled. The threat of an uprising against the state, however, must be preemptively shut down by excluding the Trotskyites from our society to camps far, far away, in order to ensure a peaceful people within Russian borders. With the Politburo now on board, all the USSR shall be freed from Trotskyist influence."
 SOV_Great_Purge.2.A: "Stalin's leadership must be secured!"

 SOV_Great_Purge.3.t: "Trial of the Anti-Soviet Trotskyist Center"
 SOV_Great_Purge.3.d: "Despite the fact that Trotsky was removed from his position over a decade ago, his influence lives on in the form of our generals, who regard such values as better and more efficient. We saw these people as competitors, people who were deemed more worthy in comparison, but ultimatelyhad to go. The Trial of the Sixteen removed many Trotskyists, most notably Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev, who were influenced by Trotsky's ideas. Under pressure and in constant fear of being killed, Trotsky himself sought asylum in Mexico, but was tried as the main conspirator in his absence.\n\nThe NKVD has now obtained some vital information about Pyatakov, including his visit to Trotsky in Norway. This activity has been deemed anti-party and anti-Soviet by the party. Pyatakov was personally appointed as a witness by Stalin at the infamous Moscow Trial of Kamenev and Zinoviev in the summer of 1936, and now, regarded as a traitor himself, Pyatakov and his defendant Karl Radek, have been sentenced to death. Hopefully, Trotsky's puppet strings in the party will be forever cut..."
 SOV_Great_Purge.3.A: "How many more trials will there be?"

 SOV_Great_Purge.4.t: "Tukhachevsky's Case"
 SOV_Great_Purge.4.d: "As the trials come to a close, we have one of the final puzzle pieces needed to properly purge the Trotskyists from our communist party. One of the deep operation theorists, Mikhail Tukhachevsky, was seized and transported back to Moscow in a prison van. After a lengthy interrogation by the NKVD, Tukhachevsky collapsed and immediately admitted to being a German agent. While we finally have one of the last enemies of the state in our hands, it's possible we could let Tukhachevsky off in favour of another scapegoat, saving us a great general. After some consideration, Stalin has suggested to charge one of Tukhachevsky's close associates, Rokossovsky. The court faces a long night deciding which of these two is more anti-party."
 SOV_Great_Purge.4.A: "Tukachevsky is an enemy of the state, he said it himself. Sentence him to death!"
 SOV_Great_Purge.4.B: "Tukachevsky is a symptom rather than the source, sentence Rokossovsky, and keep Tukachevsky close."

 SOV_Great_Purge.5.t: "Teutonic Menace"
 SOV_Great_Purge.5.d: "Since the age of Alexander Nevsky to the Kaiser's predatory eyes, the Teutonic Menace has posed a severe threat to our nation and people. With the ascent of Adolf Hitler, it appears that this menace will once again threaten the motherland. With their Judeo-Bolshevism discourse and direct targeting of our German brothers of similar mentality, it is clear that in the future, they will follow in the footsteps of their teutonic forebears and try to hit us while we are weak.\n\nTo counter such a threat, we must seek foreign allies, yet doing so would necessitate collaboration with the Western bourgeoisie, our other destined adversary. A decision must be made between temporarily suspending our ideological struggle in order to deal with a larger threat and fighting this war in our own methods."
 SOV_Great_Purge.5.A: "The Union now looks westward..."

 SOV_Great_Purge.6.t: "The Common Threat"
 SOV_Great_Purge.6.d: "We have known since the days of the Tsar that the capitalist west is our ideological enemy. But, with the Teutonic eagle preying its eyes on Europe and grabbing for meat, we must consider their threat. The possibility of a Teutonic attack must be stopped, and the Union cannot do so on its own; we must work with the West. It is not an easy decision to make, but it must be made. With some "help" from France, the UK, and Czechoslovakia, we might be able to stop the Germans before they show their teeth. For the peace and security of Europe, let's stop the fascist menace before they do any more harm!"
 SOV_Great_Purge.6.A: "An Anti-Fascist front that will span the globe!"

 SOV_Great_Purge.7.t: "7th World Congress of the Comintern"
 SOV_Great_Purge.7.d: "The 7th World Congress of the Communist International began this evening in Moscow's House of Unions' Hall of Pillars. The gathering, held almost exactly seven years after the last Comintern World Congress, was attended by 513 delegates representing 65 Comintern member parties and 19 sympathising parties.\n\nThe keynote address delivered by Wilhelm Pieck of the Communist Party of Germany set the tone for the 7th World Congress. While praising the 1928 tactic of "class against class," Pieck admitted that "a certain number of sectarian mistakes were made." During the late 1920s strike movement, this push for ideologically pure leadership divided workers, gaining the support of some while alienating others and ultimately failing due to "clumsy and sectarian tactics."\n\nFollowing Pieck's keynote report and the lengthy discussion that followed, a second report, this time by Georgi Dimitrov, was presented on the task of building working-class unity in opposition to fascism. Dimitrov began by defining fascism as "the open terrorist dictatorship of the most reactionary, chauvinistic, and imperialist elements of finance capital," intent on wreaking organised "terrorist vengeance against the working class and the revolutionary section of the peasantry and intelligentsia." Dimitrov described fascism's foreign policy as "jingoism in its most brutal form, fomenting bestial hatred of other nations."The 7th World Congress resulted in the endorsement of a Popular Front of communist and non-communist forces against the growing threat of fascism in Europe, paving the way for advocacy of collective security between our country and the various capitalist states of Europe." This represents a dramatic shift away from the Comintern's previous support for class warfare, which was endorsed by the 6th World Congress."
 SOV_Great_Purge.7.A: "United against fascism."

 SOV_Great_Purge.9.t: "Choosing Molotov"
 SOV_Great_Purge.9.d: "“The Soviet Government intends to improve its relations with Hitler, and if possible, sign a pact with Nazi Germany. As a Jew and an avowed opponent of such a policy… you stand in the way."\n\nLitvinov's immediate reaction was one of disbelief, then fiery anger. He stood up and banged on the table, arguing over the claim, ready to defend his policies, his faith, his entire career. The meeting room grew tenser, as the others waited for Stalin's response. He sucked on his pipe and said with a chilling tone:\n\n"Enough."\n\nThe man of steel thrust a paper of registration, already filled out, towards Litvinov. \n\n“Sign.”\n\nSeeing the futility of his situation, he took up a pen and signed it. NKVD agents are currently surrounding the Foreign Office, and Molotov, Beria, and Malenkov are expected to inform him of his dismissal any second now. While we will keep Litvinov in the party, with him out of the government, Molotov can finally take his place as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Molotov's foreign policy will help us solidify a pact with Germany, further establish our influence in Europe, and reconcile with Japan. Litvinov failed to do anything with the Allied powers, but Molotov won't fail with the Axis."
 SOV_Great_Purge.9.A: "Sorry Maxim, things change."

 SOV_Great_Purge.12.t: "Memento Mori"
 SOV_Great_Purge.12.d: "“So poor old Kirov is dead? This… this is a loss for the Soviet Union”.\n\nThe adviser had never seen Stalin look genuinely sad and disappointed in hearing the death of an old comrade, as most of the time, he had organized their deaths. But not this time. This one came as a complete shock to Stalin, and one that upset him greatly.\n\nSergei Kirov, a friend, a comrade, and a true revolutionary. He had always been with Stalin since the days of the October Revolution of 1917, rising through the various ranks of the Communist Party and eventually settling as the head of the party in Leningrad. And even though Stalin would be seen as his superior, he was never treated that way by the General Secretary, and even found himself on the Politburo when Stalin came to power. However, all of that came to a sudden halt, when Kirov was shot by who NKVD sources are calling a “known Zinovievist”, Leonid Nikolaev. While those who have been deemed responsible have been put on trial and dealt with, this is far from the end.\n\n“We do not know how many more of these counter-revolutionaries and revisionists remain within the cracks of the party. They could be in the army, the navy the airforce, perhaps even the politburo! This is the beginning of something that will ensure the revolution lives on, and one by one, those who disagree with the principles of the revolution will be cut from society…”\n\nAs Stalin trailed off into a paranoid rant, the adviser only hoped that what was to come would spare him from any fateful end."

 SOV_Great_Purge.15.t: "The End of Yezhov"
 SOV_Great_Purge.15.d: "Yezhov wandered aimlessly through Moscow's streets and back alleys, drink in hand, slowly stumbling in the general direction of his home. How could he, once the NKVD's king, have been reduced to this? Yezhov's face twisted into a scowl. Of course, he knew the answer: it was all because of that pudgy psychopath, Beria. He should have expedited that monster’s execution immediately when he ordered it in ‘38. If he had, Beria would never have had the opportunity to appeal to Stalin for mercy.\n\nYezhov tripped over a crack in the pavement and briefly fell to the ground. As he stood up to continue walking, the Kremlin in the distance caught his eye. It's not like he hadn't noticed his power was being usurped. The reassignment of his first deputy, Mikhail Frinovsky, signaled the impending "dismissal." He should known, because he used to organize such dismissals. Hell, he did the same thing to his chief predecessor.\n\nOf course, Frinovsky, like many of Yezhov's proteges, had been formally arrested a few months before. He had time to warn his old friend and mentee Aleksandr Uspensky, who went into hiding, but who knew how long he would be able to avoid capture. If he had learned anything about running the NKVD, it was how effective the organization was at locating and eliminating its targets.\n\nThere was no one left for Yezhov to rely on, neither student nor ally. Politically he had become radioactive. No member of the Politburo would dare talk to him outside of their assigned work for fear of being associated with him. Yezhov didn't even have his wife. While there had never been a great love between them, to have seen her commit suicide using those sleeping pills weighed heavily upon him.\n\nAs he finally stumbled back to the block that held his apartment, his eyes sluggishly focused on the two men in uniform standing at the entrance to the building. A feeling of ice pierced Yezhov’s heart as one of the men opened his mouth to speak the words Yezhov knew were coming."

 SOV_Great_Purge.19.d: "Oleg and Olga had never left the Moscow suburbs before, only knowing a life of cramped living conditions and smokey streets from the factories that had sprouted up across the city. They did, however, discover a new way of life all the way down in Crimea, one of the forest, new friendships, and devotion to the revolution.\n\nArtek, the first All-Union Young Pioneer camp, opened in 1925 and offered a variety of activities for children aged 7 to 15. Unlike the Hitler Youth or the League of German Maidens, both boys and girls participated together, with an emphasis on comradery and togetherness. This was good for Oleg and Olga because they were close and did everything they could together.\n\nOleg and Olga were sent to Artek by their local trade union in Moscow, and they had no idea what they were getting themselves into, or what life would be like in another part of the Union. However, after being greeted by an enthusiastic camp leader, they quickly found themselves pushing the boundaries of what they would normally do, from learning basic survival skills to assist in the wilderness to team building exercises like den building and mapping exercises.\n\nIf there was one part of the day that they both enjoyed the most, it was at the end of each day, when the children gathered to sing patriotic songs and tell stories about the revolution. And as they settled into their cabins each night, they knew that they and the revolution were safe, as the portrait of Stalin watched over them, looking ahead to a future that none of them could predict."

And, after all this time, many of his plans have been realised: Russia is rapidly industrialising, the army has been cleansed of Trotskyist opposition, and, at long last, he has emerged as the Soviet Union's sole true leader.\n\nHowever, even thirteen years after his death, Stalin continues to refer to one man: Vladimir Lenin. The man who brought the revolutionaries together, the man who paved the way for the Bolsheviks to seize power. However, Stalin did not completely disregard Lenin's legacy. Of course, he and Lenin disagreed on how and when the revolution should spread, but Leon Trotsky had the same reservations about communism in one country during his lifetime.\n\nBut now Stalin must choose between continuing to do things his way and respecting Lenin's legacy. Should he choose to assume Lenin's mantle, he will do what he believes is best for communism, but always in the name of the man who gave his name to Marxism-Leninism. In contrast, if he chooses to be the Servant of Lenin, Joseph Stalin will be required to be more respectful of Lenin's reforms and way of thinking, as the first revolutionary who changed the way in Russia.\n\nThe final choice, of course, lies only with him…"

Now, the Soviet Union must serve as a rallying point for the revolution so that the cause of socialism can be spread throughout the world. Rather than limiting themselves to forming a united front with working-class parties, Communist parties should seek to form a popular front with all anti-fascist parties.\n\nThe capitalist system is nearing its end, and unless a socialist revolution sweeps Europe and the world, we will be crushed by world capitalism's military might, just as the Paris Commune was crushed by force of arms in 1871. And remember: an internationalist is someone who is willing to defend the USSR without reservation, without wavering, unconditionally; the USSR is the foundation of the global revolutionary movement, and this revolutionary movement cannot be defended and promoted unless the USSR is defended.\n\nLong live our magnificent Motherland, her liberty, and independence!

But today Second Secretary Lazar Kaganovich was about to set something in motion that would forever alter the future of the Soviet Union.\n\nAs the session drew to a close, Kaganovich received a letter from Stalin's courier: He was to prepare the trial and execution of Marshal Voroshilov. As the members of the Politburo left, he relayed a message to Marshal Budyonny, requesting his immediate presence. Simultaneously, he called upon Kalinin and Molotov, two men he trusted with his life.\n\n"Stalin's paranoia has completely consumed him. While Stalin is in hiding and sending his petty communiques, the State is growing weaker and more unstable by the day. We have to do something, lest Stalin completely ruin the Union."\n\nKaganovich then looked at the faces of the two and awaited their reaction. He could see that they were shocked, horrified even. But could sense that they were in partial agreement to his words.\n\n"Lazar, what are you saying? You will get us all killed just for talking about this!", Molotov replied.\n\n"I have just  received this letter, stating that Voroshilov is to be put on trial and executed. We all know that Voroshilov is as loyal as they come. If Stalin is willing to kill his closest and most loyal comrades, then who knows if we, or maybe even the entire Politburo, might be next? It is time we put an end to this madness."\n\n"I don't like this Lazar, but I know that you are right. This affair with Voroshilov is just too much.", Molotov said.

As they approach the Dacha, they were stopped by NKVD guards, who, upon seeing the armed escort of the entourage, started aiming their weapons at them: "Second Secretary, what is the meaning of this?". "Stalin holds no authority anymore. You are outnumbered. Lay down your weapons and your lives shall be spared", Kaganovich replied. The guards hesitated for a moment, but in the end, decided to comply. They were handcuffed and escorted out of the area, while Kaganovich's entourage entered the Dacha proper.\n\nAfter the entourage reached Stalin's office, they barged in & saw Stalin sitting on his desk attending to a large pile of documents. Before the General Secretary could inquire upon the reason for the intrusion, Budyonny drew his "Honorary Revolutionary Weapon" upon Stalin. Molotov pulled out a document from his coat and handed the paper to Kaganovich, who starts reading it aloud: "Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, after the necessary investigations conducted by the Politburo, you have been found guilty of treason and plotting against the Soviet State. And are hereby sentenced to execution". In a fiery outburst, he started screaming and cursing, threatening to have the "conspirators" and everyone they know shot. But his rambling was cut short by Budyonny's bullet.\n\nAfter the General Secretary fell to the ground, the entourage left the office. Outside, Kaganovich was approached by a Captain, asking what to do with the NKVD guards. "They are all guilty of treason. Execute them." The young officer nodded and ran off. With a series of gunshots from the executions ringing in the background, Kaganovich turned to Molotov and Budyonny: "My comrades. We have done it. We have saved the Soviet Union."

Although there was some military infighting on the streets, it is now certain that the coup has ended.\n\nSo far, we know that the rebellion was led by none other than Lazar Kaganovich, one of the closest collaborators of Stalin in the Politburo.\nThe "Politburo Coup," as it was quickly nicknamed, gathered the majority of the Politburo and united in an attack on Stalin's dacha. This betrayal is the result of Stalin's recent incapacity, as he vanished from Moscow after ordering the arrest of Kliment Voroshilov. Immediately following the plot, Kaganovich declared that the attack, as well as Stalin's death, were the fault of the NKVD, which had betrayed the Union.

We have decided to take similar measures in the purging of many Soviet politicians. Although through the use of show trials, their guilt on the actions they are accused of may be questionable, they are undoubtedly a corrupting source within our administration. In the October house of unions in Moscow, sixteen individuals who had been suspected of a plethora of crimes, ranging from terrorism to plotting an assassination on Joseph Stalin, were found guilty of all charges. They were promptly sentenced to death and subsequently brought to the cellars of Lubyanka Prison were they each had a bullet put through their skulls. Prominent members of the sixteen executed individuals include Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev and whilst their absence leaves a hole in our political governance, their deaths mark the beginning of a greater struggle for purity within the USSR."

Whilst the trial itself may not have been as significant as the last, it sets the stage for important later trials that will take place. The implications of Radek have made it clear that the military, along with many other political sections, is not to be trusted. We will see to them in the future.

A relatively junior officer from the Volga Military District pointed out how the Red Army’s leadership is being culled of the so-called “Trotskyites” and has made many of the commanders fearful of their lives, as executions and dismissals have become almost regular.

These Reformists held most of the sway in these meetings, and their support was necessary if anything substantial was to come out of these meetings. Marshal Tukhachevsky, often the most vocal in these meetings, began by expressing his dissatisfaction with the lack of action that had been taken, lamenting over how even Comrade Lenin’s closest associates had not been spared in the ongoing violent purge, and how only the “removal” of Stalin could stop the madness. Many were visibly aghast at the word “removal” but encouraged by the “Ayes” of the others, specifically the Reformists, Tukhachevsky resumed by enumerating that the purge would never end, possibly until he himself got shot.

His desperate pleas were being constantly interrupted by punches, kicks and his own crying and sobbing, after reaching the Red Square, he was thrown face down onto the pavement, breaking his nose, and causing his blood to stain the brick. Not long after, a truck arrived, carrying fifteen of the most senior NKVD officials that had been present at the Lubyanka building, which had surrendered almost immediately after realizing the overwhelming number of the Army troops.\n\nFollowing an improvised proceeding in the middle of the nearly empty Red Square, the Marshal sentenced Stalin and the NKVD personnel, sixteen men who represented a symbolic reprisal for the sixteen who had been “convicted” at the start of the Purge. Stalin, who had crawled like an infant in the ground, was still wailing and was forced to get on his knees, with the others.

After Lenin’s death, a "troika" consisting of Grigory Zinoviev of the Ukrainian SSR, Lev Kamenev of the Russian SFSR, and Joseph Stalin of the Transcaucasian SFSR led the nation after a brief struggle against Leon Trotsky and his supporters, with the power being eventually consolidated under the seat of the incumbent General Secretary Joseph Stalin.\n\nThough seemingly a powerful and strong figure to some, the leader has had his fair share of failings - a debatable involvement in the eventual disaster in the Polish campaign, destructive attitudes in fulfilling his policies of industrialization and collectivization that have killed many and even generated famines, it is alleged that even the founding father, Lenin in his last days was concerned about Stalin and had tried to facilitate his dismissal to prevent his future involvement in the government’s policies.\n\nMuch of the critique against him has generally been random and unorganized, but finally and for the greater good, unfounded as well as founded accounts indicate that the dissension against him has been consolidated and is now organized among and with the patronage of some high ranking Politburo members. Though the extent and scope is not fully known, it has become quite evident that opposition against Stalin and his policies is starting to manifest and has become indicative to other Party members as well."

Kamenev and Zinoviev have long been considered as Stalin rivals and even Nikolai Bukharin’s disagreements with the General Secretary regarding the decision of collectivization, which led to millions of deaths and his subsequent drifting away from Stalin all indicate their possible involvement in the “Opposition”. But the rumors about Sergei Kirov’s involvement, which some think to be absurd are the real shockers considering his personal relationship with the General Secretary, though seemingly improbable, he is an influential member and commands enough respect to even refuse Stalin’s directives, whatever the case maybe it remains clear for any action to be taken against Stalin by the politburo, all the sections will play decisive roles, especially with the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party coming up, which will elect the Central Committee."

In his speech he highlighted his achievements and his work for the socialist cause, enumerating his “contribution” to the society by mentioning the recently completed first five-year plan and his collectivization policies, at that moment there was a snide remark by a party member “Millions Dead, seem to be a good enough contribution to the cause”, Stalin was confounded by such a brazen disrespect of his authority, and with no opposition from any other party members, the full scope of the “Opposition” became evident.\n\nAfter fumbling, never used to such an interruption Stalin continued albeit now with less clarity and proceeded with further attacks against his critics, accusing them of being agents of Trotsky attempting to bring down the State from within to fulfill the nefarious goals of anti-revolutionaries. Despite some cheers and approvals from some of the Stalinist supporters, the indifferent attitudes and rhetorics by many clearly indicated that the General Secretary had lost a large amount of approval, which would in all cases be evident and manifest in the upcoming 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party."

 #### 17th Congress Events
 SOV_XVII_Congress.1.t: "First day of the 17th Congress"
 SOV_XVII_Congress.1.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]It is another historic event here today in the capital Moscow, for revolutionaries from all sides of the political aisle have gathered here today to convene the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party. \n\nAttended by more than a thousand delegates who have been handpicked to proactively and pragmatically represent the many sectors and party members in the Communist Party, this Congress will discuss a wide variety of issues from Party Organization Reform to the status of the brilliant Five Year Plan which has brought unprecedented levels of prosperity never before seen in Russia in history, along with electing various of our comrades into the important organs of the Party.\n\nThis is a historic day, whose deliberations and decisions shall shape our glorious Union forever!"
 SOV_XVII_Congress.1.A: "I hereby call to order..."

 SOV_XVII_Congress.2.t: "Comrade Stalin's Reports"
 SOV_XVII_Congress.2.d: "“Comrades, more than three years have passed since the Sixteenth Congress. That is not a very long period. But it has been fuller in content than any other period- I do not think that any period in the last decade has been so rich in events like this one.”\n\nStalin's report centers on three main areas:\n-The great depression ravaging the capitalist world, which is unprecedented in its length and severity. In contrast to this, the USSR's production has more than doubled,\nclearly showing the superiority of the socialist model.\n-The growing tensions between the European powers, and between Japan and China, which threaten to plunge the world into war once more.\n-Soviet diplomatic relations with the rest of the world, which have improved greatly with the signing of nonaggression pacts with Poland, Finland, Italy, and France. Relations have been restored with the United States and China as they see our increasing economic and military might.\n\nAs the speech comes to an end, applause can be heard ringing throughout the congress chambers- even some members of Nikolai Bukharin's right opposition can be seen clapping and cheering. As the applause dies down, the General Secretary makes one last remark..."
 SOV_XVII_Congress.2.A: "Praise the good work of the Party"
 SOV_XVII_Congress.2.B: "Makes a neutral and Bureaucratic Discourse"
 SOV_XVII_Congress.2.C: "Criticize the party and demand improvements"

 SOV_XVII_Congress.3.t: "The Party recognizes their failures"
 SOV_XVII_Congress.3.d: "We expected today a rejection of blame from the party- what we did not expect was that they would accept the criticism, and that is what has come to pass.\nThe party is not monolithic, and there is always dissent, but on most occasions, a compromise is made and a decision announced. Stalin's harsh criticism of the party hasn't made him any new friends, but it seems enough of the politburo to see the truth in Stalin's criticisms to make a statement. However, by carefully examining the reactions of the politburo members, a deeper truth can be found. It seems that the decision to accept culpability for what many see as Stalin's failures was hotly contested behind closed doors and that a large bloc of the politburo does not agree with their peers. Going forward, this split will likely affect the politburo's decision making for the rest of the congress, if not longer. A delegate to the left whispers ominously.\n\n“What was it that American President said?”"
 SOV_XVII_Congress.3.A: "The Party will betray the revolution nevermore."

 SOV_XVII_Congress.4.t: "The Members did not Accept Criticisms"
 SOV_XVII_Congress.4.d: "After Comrade Stalin put forth fierce criticism of the CPSU and its members in his reports about the general state of the Union, many were quick to disregard these accusations as outrageous and the specific problems as “blown out of proportion“ and “not representative for the state of the Union and Revolution“. And while many party members were content with these statements, fine with the reassuring pat on their back put forth by their fellow comrades, there were others who were deeply affected by Comrade Stalin's reports.\nWhat did the party truly achieve from the start of the Revolution?\nTrue they won the war against the Reactionaries but after that? The dream of the world revolution died before Warsaw, the dream of eternal prosperity died with the plethora of international sanctions and the revolutionary spirit of 1917 drowned in a sea of misery and war. The dream of the communist utopia simply vanished in the face of the cold reality. But who could be blamed? The farmer who toils in the fields to prevent another famine from plaguing the country? The factory worker who works long hours in the factories to ensure that the Union is on par with the capitalist countries?\nThe soldiers, who are ready to give their blood and lives to keep the revolution going? No, they can't be blamed, for they still give everything for the Revolution. Soon the delegates realized that only the party can be blamed and that only they can correct the mistakes they made, that improvement is needed to rekindle the flame of the Revolution. And improve they will, for only the party will be able to guide the proletariat towards utopia"
 SOV_XVII_Congress.4.A: "A house divided against itself..."

 SOV_XVII_Congress.5.t: "The Five Year Plan Debate"
 SOV_XVII_Congress.5.d: "Next on our agenda is a speech from Vyacheslav Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, and Valerian Kuybyshev, Chairman of the State Planning Committee, on the necessity of a second 5-year plan. While the first 5-year plan overhauled agriculture in the union, seeing state-enforced collectivization, the "liquidation" of the Kulaks, and the construction of a foundation for heavy industry, it did not fully meet all of its goals- greatest of them a full transition of the economy to socialism. Molotov and Kuybyshev propose a second 5-year plan that will achieve the remaining uncompleted objectives of the first, as well as create further heavy industry and infrastructure. Both Molotov and Kuybyshev are close allies of Stalin's, and going through with the plan will greatly increase the General Secretary's power over the state and economy. On the other hand, as many of the delegates have observed, the first 5-year plan's successes came at a cost and even so weren't entirely successful."

 SOV_XVII_Congress.6.t: "Organizational Issues"
 SOV_XVII_Congress.6.d: "To be a card-carrying member of the party no longer means what it used to, and Lazar Kaganovich has come before the politburo to tell us of what can be done. Since the Bolsheviks under Lenin seized the apparatus of the state, party membership has become more and more necessary for everyday life in the union. As such, membership has exploded, and many of these new members are... less than dedicated to our goals. Kaganovich suggests that we extend party membership only to those who have proven themselves through work in a social organization, and increase the number of recommendations required to join. Finally, Kaganovich proposes that we replace the current Rabkrin, the committee designed to expose corruption and government wrongdoing, with a new People's Control Commission dedicated to the oversight of the many oblasts, krais and autonomous republics of the Union."

 SOV_XVII_Congress.7.t: "Elections to the Central Organs of the Party"
 SOV_XVII_Congress.7.d: "At last, the most important issue on our agenda is the matter of elections to the party's Central Committee. The Politburo will stay largely the same as it is now, with only one position changing hands, but the Secretariat will see radical change, with a majority of its members being replaced. Despite all these changes, most delegates expect Josef Stalin to retain the post of General Secretary. However, perhaps there is one who could challenge Stalin for leadership- Sergei Kirov. Kirov has always had the support of a wide swathe of the party and has started to drift away from Stalinism, exerting more and more independence from Moscow every day. Perhaps Stalin's ten-year rule will soon come to an end."

 SOV_XVII_Congress.8.t: "Significant Votes Against Stalin"
 SOV_XVII_Congress.8.d: "The early votes have come in, and they paint a grim picture for Stalin's continued leadership. The party leadership uses a voting system where candidates are voted against, and the candidate with the fewest votes against takes the position- Stalin has already received a significant amount of those votes. What might have been unthinkable a few years ago now presents itself as a tantalizing opportunity- the removal of General Secretary Joseph Stalin? Much of the party has always hated the old enforcer, some even claiming Lenin tried to prevent Stalin's leadership from his deathbed, but they have never had a good way to oust him- until now. In dim backrooms and hotel rooms, a plot is beginning to coalesce. They can get the votes, all they need now is a candidate to take the General Secretaryship, and they already have someone in mind. Though once a Stalin ally, he has slowly drifted away from Stalin in recent years, preferring vibrant St. Petersburg to the halls of power in Moscow."

 SOV_XVII_Congress.9.d: "Long after a party spokesman was expected to announce the next general secretary, a nervous young man dashes to the podium to deliver a hastily prepared statement. The unlucky aide looks out over the crowd, visibly shaken, and speaks so quickly it's hard to understand his words. "The party has decided that to maintain strong leadership in this time of crisis, comrades Kirov, Molotov, and Kalinin will form a provisional government." The chambers are silent for a moment before they explode into activity, a tsunami of sound washing over the seated crowd. Delegates scramble across the floor for hurried discussions with their friends and allies.\n“This is unprecedented!”\n“Is that legal? Can they do that?”\n“At least Kirov's on the provisional government.”\n“Now this is why we should have voted for Stalin.”\n\nAfter a time, the discussion dies down, and the new troika, reminiscent of the triumvirates of Rome, will begin their work to lead and protect the revolution."
 SOV_XVII_Congress.9.A: "But which will be Caesar?"

 SOV_XVII_Congress.10.t: "The Party goes with the Opposition"
 SOV_XVII_Congress.10.d: "A heavy silence smothers the congress chambers when the party's decision is announced, and Nikolai Bukharin's opposition is asked to create a new government. Making up the "right" wing of the Party, the opposition and their allies had been in decline all over the socialist world- until now. Bukharin slowly walks up to the front of the room, and every single footstep can be heard echoing through the vast emptiness of the congregation hall. As the old revolutionary takes the podium, every single eye is fixed on him, scanning, searching for any clue for his next words.\nComrade Bukharin smiles and humbly accepts the monumental task of leading the revolution in these most perilous of times.\nWhen our Union is threatened, when the reactionaries circle like hungry wolves around us, Bukharin will do everything to protect the revolution, our revolution, from those who would crush the workers under their boot."

Sergei Kirov lacked the will and determination to our glorious cause and he shall be remembered as a loser against comrade Stalin and shall be forgotten by history. Our comrade Stalin certainly lacked neither the will nor the determination to The Motherland, he knows what it takes to be a true member of The Party. His name shall be written in history books as was foretold. May he leads us to glory and once more the world shall fear the Red Menace."

Leningrad party boss Sergei Kirov, once a steadfast ally of General Secretary Stalin, has come forward claiming he was approached by a rogue faction of the politburo after last night's proceedings. Kirov says the traitors offered him the post of General Secretary upon ousting comrade Stalin, but he immediately refused and went straight to Stalin to report the plot. While the plot has been foiled, for now, this incident has shown that dissent does exist in the highest echelons of the party. Worse still, the dissenters are bold enough to go about their plotting right under the General Secretary's nose. Bukharin is safe, for now, but it may be wise for him to find other allies."

A party functionary calls the congress to a close with what might have been a small sigh of relief, and the event is finally over. The assembly begins to shuffle out of the congress chambers and down the halls, dog tired.\nAll the delegates are happy to return home to their wives and families at long last, and some prepare for a long journey to the furthest corners of the Union in the Caucasus and far east.\n\nAfter weeks of constant cacophony, the Kremlin finally falls silent.\n\nDecisions made these two weeks will guide the course of both the Soviet Union and the international socialist revolution for years to come, and will surely change the world as well. Here though, the citizens of the USSR can only hope that the delegates have acted in their best interest, and time will tell if they have."
 SOV_XVII_Congress.13.d1: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]After much deliberations, the proceedings of the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party have concluded in the city of Moscow, the capital of the country. The meeting has been labeled as the "Congress of Victors" to mark the success of the first five-year plan and the collectivization of agriculture.\n\nApart from the main agendas discussed by the body, the composition of the Central Committee was also elected, and to the shock of many, the Congress voted out the current General Secretary, Joseph Stalin with well over one hundred votes against him.\n\nSergei Kirov, a very prominent politician, part of the “Old Guard ” and a personal friend of Joseph Stalin himself has been elected as the new General Secretary and will be heading a Troika comprising of Party veterans Vyacheslav Molotov and Mikhail Kalinin as the leaders of the Central Committee. Kirov, the current head of the Communist Party in Leningrad only received 3 votes against. His ideas are well known in the party, a strong supporter of industrialization and collectivization in the Country, it is widely believed in the country that the new General Secretary will bring much glory to the Worker’s cause."

But instead, the highlight has been the formation of a “Provisional Government”, headed by long time party member Nikolai Bukharin.\n\nThe current General Secretary Joseph Stalin received more than 100 votes against him for the Central Committee elections, making it evident that it was impossible for him to be elected in the face of such great opposition from Party ranks. A staunch proponent of the New economic policy during the early 1920s, many are scratching their heads, trying to predict the direction in which Comrade Bukharin will steer the nation to, but rest assured the people of the glorious Soviet Union will continue to thrive under his guiding hand."

A reality understood by all, yet we find ourselves facing something we couldn’t have predicted in our darkest dreams.\n\nSwollen faces, legs and arms. Graves that seem without end. Hate, fear and hopelessness. These are all part of the everyday lives of millions of our citizens in the vast grain plains of the Soviet Union. If luck exists, then we certainly lack it, for a myriad of causes have gathered to give us what can only be called the worst famine in the history of the USSR.\n\nOur policy of urbanisation and industrialisation led to countless peasants moving in the cities to work in the factories and meet the quotas required by the Five-Year Plan. This decrease in the number of farmers should have been mitigated by increased agricultural efficiency and yield due to the collectivisation undertaken at the same time, but natural disasters, food exports and the resistance of kulaks, holders of arable land from the time of the tsar, have lead to a catastrophically low harvest.\n\nSiberia, Kazakhstan, Northern Caucasus and Ukraine are only some of the many regions affected by the lack of food. As their people starve and struggle to survive, we find ourselves unable to feed them without compromising the industrialisation program.\n\nAnd we will do no such thing.

The sheer humiliation aside, we cannot deny that we have still not caught up to the West. Thankfully, the Plan has as its aim to bring the Soviet Union to the same level as them and make us technologically independent.\n\nWhile the benefits of the food export can be clearly seen, so can the negative effects. We have already been stretching the limits of our capacity to feed the citizens with the industrialisation and urbanisation programs, but having to sell abroad our people’s source of sustenance has finally hit the nail in the figurative coffin. A famine is beginning to set in the food-producing areas of the Soviet Union, as the farmers’ yields are taken from them to feed the workers in the cities and the citizens of nations they did not even hear of.\n\nIf we wish to at least alleviate the symptoms of the disease, then action must be taken sooner than later, lest the whole body begins to suffer."

 SOV_Second_Year_Plan.9.d: "Our planned economy could be said to be a ‘work in progress’, for it has many deficiencies and what some would call ‘flaws’. One of the more concerning ones is our inability to set realistic targets and commit resources to enterprises that are in most need of them. This has been leading to widespread inability to meet the quotas set by the Five-Year Plans, not helped by the fact that the various enterprises can’t simply buy the lacking resources because of the non-existent market economy.\n\nTo overcome this conundrum, a peculiar trend has emerged in the form of Tolkachi. Literally meaning ‘pushers’, these employees have as objective the use of ‘informal connections’ to enable production managers to meet or manipulate targeted outputs imposed by the State Planning Committee, better known as ‘Gosplan’.\n\nAn obvious form of corruption, the trend has nevertheless gained momentum, so much so that the Tolkachi have come to occupy an unofficial but powerful position as mediators between the enterprises and commissariats. This tendency, however immoral and damaging, is predicted to only rise in prevalence if the very cause of its existence is not dealt with."

 SOV_NKVD_Agency: "NKVD"
 SOV_NKVD_Agency_desc: "Counterrevolutionaries and agents of the West seek to subvert the cause of our great revolution, both from the inside and the outside. It is evident we need to charge an organisation with countering these threats, the organisation must be equally ruthless and merciless to counter the threats to our great nation. It has been decided to reform the NKVD or the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs, which had been disbanded in 1930, in its latest form, it will be reinstated as an All-Union Ministry, and be handed all the responsibilities of the OGPU and more. The greatly strengthened NKVD will immediately begin countering internal subversive activities and carry out tasks in foreign lands to further the socialist cause."

 SOV_Yagodas_Iron_Fist: "Yagoda's Iron Fist"
 SOV_Yagodas_Iron_Fist_desc: "Whatever benefits and advantages the other possible candidates offer for the post of heading the NKVD, seems redundant when compared to Genrikh Yagoda. Yagoda is a man of passion and energy combined with the necessary ruthlessness needed to run the state based security apparatus, the NKVD. He will be entrusted with the task for rooting out all subversive and counter revolutionary activities in the nation, a long drawn out task, but a task suitable for Yagoda who will no doubt excel in it...for the time being at least."

 SOV_Agranovs_Pragmatic_Approach: "Agranov's Pragmatic Approach"
 SOV_Agranovs_Pragmatic_Approach_desc: "Now that a State based security apparatus has been firmly established, what must be decided upon is who should lead the NKVD and its approach in countering the national threats. While it is evident that the leadership would need to be ruthless and merciless, it seems some measure of cunningness and pragmatism will also be required. Yakov Agranov, a highly effective and competent individual, has an extensive record of countering subversive activities in the union in the past years, and his pragmatism, at least compared to the “other” option, seems to offer considerably more merit."

 SOV_Socialist_Justice: "Socialist Justice"
 SOV_Socialist_Justice_desc: "Our nation and its ideology exist for the benefit of the worker and the peasant. In Western Countries, the courts and the laws all exist to favour the greedy money men, men who seek to rob the common man for everything he’s worth, unlike our nation where the working class is not only respected, but revered, for it is the driver of the nation and its economy. The people of our nation need to be reminded of the tenets of the socialist cause, and hence it is in the national interest, to propagate “Socialist Justice”. The People's Commissariat for Justice, which was once chastised by our founding father- Lenin himself, needs to once again be reminded of its duties in working to end the class struggle and to promote equality among all."

 SOV_Arrest_Political_Enemies: "Arrest Political Enemies"
 SOV_Arrest_Political_Enemies_desc: "Some members in the VKP(b) are still uncomfortable with Comrade Stalin being the General Secretary, despite his numerous achievements, they often oppose his proposals in the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. It is a well known fact that all of Comrade Stalin’s proposals are in the most sincere interests of the nation and for furthering the socialist cause, but some of his political enemies refuse to see the bigger picture. The NKVD has recently uncovered some “links” between hid political enemies and some Trotskyite cells operating in the country, forget the personal animosity between these traitors and Comrade Stalin, they need to be arrested immediately to prevent further subversion of the socialist cause."

 SOV_Total_Party_Censorship: "Total Party Censorship"
 SOV_Total_Party_Censorship_desc: "There always has been a culture of spreading unconfirmed incidents and rumours in the party circles, the VKP(b) and its members are entrusted with the very important task of preserving the integrity of the socialist cause in the Soviet Union. Misinformation and rumours are distractions that only prohibit the members of the Party in completing their duties and seeing the complete picture. Keeping the National and Socialist interests at heart, the best course of action to prevent further unfiltered information from reaching the ears of the party members and the general population as well, is to begin extending the censorship laws, to the general population as well as to the members of the VKP(b)."

 SOV_1937_Constitutional_Elections: "1937 Constitutional Elections"
 SOV_1937_Constitutional_Elections_desc: "After the Stalin constitution which among its several other points promised democratic proceedings for the election of all governmental bodies, it is time to begin implementing such a practice in actuality. The upcoming legislative elections to the Supreme Soviet, will follow a complete “democratic” approach. Though the process is more or less redundant, as the population understands the need for the important figures, prime among them, the current General Secretary Stalin himself, instead of any other “alternative” candidates, on top of that the NKVD will ensure no “counterrevolutionary” can contest in the elections."

 SOV_XVIII_Congress: "XVIII Congress"
 SOV_XVIII_Congress_desc: "Very soon, in Moscow, the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party will begin. It will be the first one after the “purification” of the leadership from trotskyites, counterrevolutionaries and other subversive elements. Among its many agendas, it will conduct an analysis of the internal and international situation of the country, as well as its future development perspectives, and discuss important aspects of the foreign policy of the USSR, particularly our disappointment with the western democracies and their failure to adopt the policy of collective security. In the aspect of party affairs it will also attempt to sanction the new Party's statute which needs to be revised to reflect changes in the class structure of the Soviet society."

 SOV_Purges_in_the_Red_Army: "Purges in the Red Army"
 SOV_Purges_in_the_Red_Army_desc: "Our initial assumption that only the KPSS had been infiltrated by the “fifth columnists” has proven to be wrong, among other sections of the society, even the Red Army has been affected by subversive individuals, working from within the organisation itself. It’s astonishing but the latest NKVD report is very definite, and has implicated senior commanders all the way from the division level to Army level for traitorous offences, ranging from having trotskyite sympathies to being actively involved in spying and collaborating with Foreign entities…...even a few of the Marshals have been implicated. Comrade Stalin has authorised the NKVD to begin extending the purge to the Red Army as well and cleanse it of these traitorous individuals immediately."

 SOV_State_Defense_Committee: "State Defense Committee"
 SOV_State_Defense_Committee_desc: "War is upon us, the very existence of the revolution and its birthplace has been threatened, we cannot afford to lose this battle of survival. Our Nation covers an extraordinarily wide expanse of land, stretching for thousands of kilometres from the Baltic Sea, all the way to the Pacific ocean. The wide expanse creates several organisational difficulties, in an attempt to better coordinate national efforts, especially for war, it has been decided to centralise power and form a national organisation, i.e. the State Defense Committee(GKO or ГКО). The GKO which staffed by the top members of the KPSS, including General Secretary Stalin himself, will be tasked with coordinating all the national wartime efforts to maximise operability and functionality."

 SOV_Zhdanovs_Party_Supremacy: "Zhdanov's Party Supremacy"
 SOV_Zhdanovs_Party_Supremacy_desc: "In the difficult decision to adopt whose ideas in the functioning of the State Defense Committee, its chairman- General Secretary Stalin himself, has selected Zhdanov’s line of thinking. Andrei Zhdanov has long been admired by the General Secretary, and some of his ideas as to how the GKO should function has been well received by Comrade Stalin. In addition he was an active participant in the purging of the KPSS and other state organisations and hence his political reliability and sincerity towards the cause is that of the highest order. Effective immediately Zhdanov has been granted the necessary authorization to begin shaping the activities of the GKO in the way he seems it to be the most appropriate, keeping the national interests at hearts."

 SOV_Malenkovs_Pragmatic_Faction: "Malenkov's Pragmatic Faction"
 SOV_Malenkovs_Pragmatic_Faction_desc: "Georgy Malenkov heads a “pragmatic” faction opposed to Zhdanov’s policies, who favour science and engineering as conduits for moving the nation forwards. Malenkov stresses upon the universal values of science and engineering, and proposes to promote the technological experts to the highest positions in the Soviet administrative elite. Despite some opposition to his ideas, it seems Malenkov’s “pragmatic”approach offers considerably more benefits, and will most definitely allow for the maximum potential in the mobilisation of both material human resources."

 SOV_Triumph_of_Zhdanovchina: "Triumph of Zhdanovchina"
 SOV_Triumph_of_Zhdanovchina_desc: "\"Zhdanovshchina\", as advocated by Andrei Zhdanov, places high emphasis on a purified communist ideology, though many party members are receptive to his way of thinking and its tenets, some of the people from Malenkov’s “pragmatic” approach are opposed to it. Despite their consternations, Comrade Stalin has decided to adopt Zhdanov’s ideas. The General Secretary agrees with Zhdanov, in the belief that proper ideology trumps science and has called for the prioritization of political education and ideological purity. It is a general consensus in the VKP(b), and specifically in the mind of the General Secretary to go ahead with Zhdanov's ideas in their entirety."

 SOV_Socialism_Achieved: "Socialism Achieved"
 SOV_Socialism_Achieved_desc: "Since the days of the revolution, we have been pushing the boundaries of what a perfect socialist state should look like in accordance with the ideas of Engels, Marx, and Lenin. And after many years of toil and hardship, we have finally achieved a socialist society that shall be a model for all. Comrade Stalin set his sights on achieving “Socialism in one country”, and he has done this through many harsh, but necessary actions. The bourgeoisie has been crushed, workers and peasants live together in harmony, and it seems highly unlikely that capitalism can ever be restored to the Soviet Union. However, while we may be a workers utopia, some still question if our victory is final, with many citing that Lenin wanted us to go further, and bring the beacon of socialism and workers unity to many other nations across the globe. While we do not know the answer to that, what we do know is that the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics will live on forever more!"

His zeal to carry out this needed cleansing of the Union is admirable, but misguided. After the defection of the Far Eastern NKVD chief, Genrikh Lyushkov, a man Yezhov himself had protected from the purges, there is reason to believe Yezhov used his position to secure himself and his accomplices and to remove his rivals. Yezhov will be removed from his post and interrogated.

Among the many tenets that have arisen out of our achievements is Socialist Science, essential meaning, by methods of understanding and predicting social, economic and material phenomena by examining their historical trends through the use of the scientific method we are deriving outcomes and future developments, all exceedingly in favour of and contributing towards societal development in the nation.

While Yagoda in his current role in heading the People’s Commissariat of Internal Affairs has recently shown hesitancy and leniency in carrying out the General Secretary's wishes, Yezhov with his ruthlessness has overseen more and more cases against the “fifth columnists”, and successfully brought justice to their crimes. It is time for the NKVD to go through some personnel changes, firstly among the changes, the circumstances call for the appointment of Yezhov to head the NKVD."

All kulaks will either be executed, imprisoned or deported, with the purpose of fighting counter-revolution and spreading socialism. The Politburo formalized the decision in a resolution titled "On measures for the elimination of kulak households in districts of comprehensive collectivization". The Dekulakization campaign has shown great success so far and now we have the opportunity to carry out a resolute offensive against the kulaks, break their resistance, eliminate them as a class and replace their production."

Anti- Soviets, Trotskyites, Capitalists, wreckers, intellectual traitors, foreign spies, along with any and all actively working to subvert the socialist cause in any manner will be purged from the all spheres of life of the Soviet society.

 SOV_Form_Mass_NKVD_Troikas_desc: "The Soviet Union is a state besieged on all sides by enemies who desire nothing more than to see our union divided amongst the various imperial powers. In pursuit of such a goal, they have sponsored dissidents within our borders and sent in spies to destabilize our regime. Weeding out the unloyal from within our ranks before they can spread their subversive ways is of paramount importance.\n\nDuring the revolution, the NKVD’s predecessor, the Cheka, or the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission, would bring order to newly liberated territories by utilizing special troikas, committees of three officers that would act both as judge and jury in an closed trial for accused citizens, with the accusation typically being treason and other counter-revolutionary activities. This way, internal enemies of the Union could be dealt with quickly and efficiently, and we could rest assured that our truly loyal citizens could remain safe.\n\nTo that end, henceforth, the Soviet Politburo will be authorizing mass NKVD troikas to supplement the Soviet Judicial system and expedite sentencing of dissidents and traitors. Some consider these troikas to be undemocratic and extrajudicial. We consider these criticisms to be treasonous."

General Secretary Stalin holds a very favourable opinion of him, he has shown himself to be a competent and effective organiser, participating in the recent purges with great zeal, confirming his motivation and political reliability. It is time his role was expanded, and accordingly the People’s Commissariat of Affairs will be placed under his disposal to better effectivise the ongoing purges. His appointment will aim to fix “some” of the issues that have occurred due to Yezhov’s rabid bloodletting, where in the past year or so he has caused considerable irreparable damage to the economic, political and military structures of the Soviet society."

Beria enjoy’s the General Secretary Stalin’s trust, having developed a relationship while working in the Transcaucasian region, and thwarting an assasination “attempt” on him, nevertheless he was effective, ruthless and very competent while leading the Georgian OGPU, dismantling Turkish and Iranian intelligence networks in the region, while building our own in them.

Nikolai Yezhov, heading the People’s Commissariat of Internal Affairs since Yagoda’s “dismissal” has been spearheading the purges to cleanse the Soviet society. It has slowly become evident that a more heavy handed approach is needed to better crack down on the “fifth columnists”, and accordingly Yezhov has been given the authority to step up his operations.

As their ambitions draw ever closer to the Motherland and the Allies are faltering in their commitments, we must make sure we remain on good terms with our ravenous ‘friend’.\n\nThankfully, the Reich direly needs resources and ‘allies’, things which we can provide. A meeting shall be organised in Moscow between the foreign ministers of our nations, where an economic and political agreement will be reached. Ideologically incompatible, our mutual hatred of democracy is the only certitude of this pact. \n\nOf course, why talk only about non-aggression pacts and commercial agreements when the matter of territorial expansion is still uncertain? A secret protocol will be included, hidden from the eyes of the international community, which will settle the spheres of influence in the East.

Even though this will certainly anger a variety of communists movements outside our direct sphere of influence, who so far have greatly profited from our continued support and funding, a reorientation toward Coexistence will bring great wealth and prosperity to the Soviet Union, establishing a strong base for the continuation of the Revolution in a more favorable political world climate."

No doubt that we aren’t the only ones threatened by Germany, we must begin earnest talks with the west to begin implementing policies and that too effectively in order to contain the German threat.

Further development in the field of nuclear physics has meant we are coming ever closer to the first working design for a megaton-range Hydrogen bomb. The design, coined ‘Sakharov’s Third Idea’, produced rather disappointing results at first, but with further experimentation and adaptation, we can create nuclear weapons with a destructive capability unlike any other.

With a range of 8000 kilometers and a maximum speed, 20 times that of the speed of sound, the projectile is able to be weaponized with a single thermonuclear warhead, and with time, the magnitude of this payload will inevitably increase. As well as the innovative genius of the new design being able to be put into combat use, the raw power of the engine, combined with the sleekness of the missile frame may be exactly the kind of technology needed to further our efforts in the space race. In particular, our Sputnik programs may be equipped with variants of the R-7."

Once again, we were forced to reverse-engineer the technology of others in order to improve our own planes, and we copied the German BMW 003 engines. Even with this shameful necessity, the MiG-9 was ineffective, suffering from weak, unreliable engines and control problems. Our aviation minister Mikhail Khrunichev and aircraft designer A. S. Yakovlev suggested we buy some of the far more advanced Rolls-Royce Nene engines for the purpose of copying them, which was met with skepticism. Our Premier even said, "What fool will sell us his secrets?" However, despite his doubts, the British allowed the license for them and the technical blueprints when we approached them on this matter. Soon, the engines were reverse-engineered and adapted for our needs and renamed the Klimov RD-45. With this new engine being produced, we assigned the project of using it to design a jet-powered interceptor to the Mikoyan-Gurevich OKB. We even supplied them with other foreign models to incorporate into the design. The result? An effective, fast interceptor to catch and destroy enemy bombers daring to bomb Soviet soil. 2 23 mm Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23 autocannons and a 37 mm Nudelman N-37 autocannon shred enemy planes and send them burning to the ground. Although it can't yet fly at Mach 1, since it lacks an all-flying tail, it can still outmaneuver our enemies well enough to be mass-produced. Soon, the MiG-15 will be certain proof that we are superior."

However, despite Soviet superiority, we have been unable to catch up to, much less surpass, the imperialists. Our pride, the long-ranged Tu-4, is but a copy of the American B-29, and it shames our nation to be unable to develop our own, more efficient planes. However, we have recently created the notably powerful Mikulin AM-3 turbojet. This engine might allow us to create a sizable jet-powered bomber. This project has been once again assigned to the Tupolev OKB, which has never failed us before, not even in the struggles of reverse-engineering American bombers. After many months of arduous work, we have gotten results: the Tu-88 prototype has won a competition against the Il-46 and has been approved for production under the service designation Tu-16. Three turbojets power this monster, which can carry a single FAB-9000 9,000 kg bomb or several nuclear weapons. It also carries several Raduga-type anti-ship missiles, for attacks against the enemy navy, and can defend itself with 6 to 7 23 mm Afanasev Makarov AM-23 cannons.

The devastation of our past wars still needs to be healed, but we can profit from what we have learned to outsmart our enemies the next time invaders set foot on Soviet soil."

 SOV_Main_Battle_Tanks_desc: "The T-34 was once thought the pinnacle of Soviet ingenuity and design. It had the best balance of firepower, protection, mobility and cost for any tank of its time. But its time has passed. Technology forges ahead, and we cannot wait for progress to come on its own. Therefore, we have put substantial resources into the development of a new kind of armored vehicle, one never before seen on the battlefield. Our main battle tanks, the first of which will be called the T-54, will thunder through our enemies' defenses and spread the Soviet way by force if need be. These tanks will become the armor of the Soviet Union and all those under our influence, protecting against imperialism and capitalist ways. The T-54 should begin production as soon as possible."

 SOV_BTR: "Bronetransportery"
 SOV_BTR_desc: "During our previous wars, the regular Soviet infantryman lacked the speed and the protection of a regular tank, leaving them more vulnerable to enemy fire while prohibiting our generals to do complex formations. The addition of both factors meant that it took more time more men and in general, more supplies and dedication to secure smaller territories, this, in turn, slowed our general advance and inflicted upon us more casualties. As the general demographics in the Soviet Union are becoming more and more imbalanced due to our previous 'troubles' both in the Homefront and the multiple conflicts we faced abroad, we can not allow ourselves to sacrifice waves of young Soviet men anymore. That is why we have conceived a new type of armored vehicle, our brave engineers at Zavod simply called it the 'armored transporter'... well... although the name isn't inspiring, this armored vehicle will allow us to drop our troops directly on the battlefield and support them on the long term allowing us to limit casualties and seize any objectives at lighting speed!"

However, we had always lacked the engines needed to provide these heavy fighters with sufficient performance. As soon as we developed these engines, we decided the first step to obtaining heavy fighters was to have them designed by the Central Design Bureau. Sergey Ilyushin and his skilled team of engineers have created the TsKB-55. We awarded it the VVS designation BSh-2, but our hopes were dashed - it underperformed in combat situations because of its weight, which was more than it could carry. Because of this, it was redesigned as the TsKB-57, a lighter single-seat design, which passed the Acceptance Trials and was baptized as the Il-2. This new heavy fighter has overcome the limitations of its predecessor and proved capable for actual combat missions. Its maximum speed of 414 km/h will allow it to dash past its competitors, and its range of 720 km will allow it to perform longer missions. With an armament of 2 × fixed forward-firing 23×152mm VYa-23 cannons that contain 150 rounds per gun, 2 × fixed forward-firing 7.62×54mmR ShKAS machine guns that contain 750 rounds per gun, 1 × manually aimed 12.7×108mm Berezin UBT machine gun in rear cockpit that contains 300 rounds, and up to 600 kg (1,320 lb) of bombs and 8 × RS-82 rockets 4 × RS-132 rockets, this fighter will be unchallenged in the sky."

Investment in high-tech fighters and close air support planes will allow us to organize our combat operations in a more holistic manner. The increasing use and development of jets rather than the traditional propeller engines open the path to a new breed of potentially supersonic fighter planes. The MiG-9 is a new and innovative design for the next generation of Soviet fighters, investment in these new technologies is vital."

 SOV_Long_Range_Aviation: "Long Range Aviation"
 SOV_Long_Range_Aviation_desc: "Our army high command has seen the need for a strategic bombing capability similar to that of the United States. We have already designed the four-engined Pe-8, but it has become obsolete compared to superior American bombers. Luckily, we have been able to capture several B-29s as they crashed in our territory following American raids on their enemies. The Tupolev OKB was assigned to cloning and reverse-engineering these models, and they have had success. However, difficulties have arisen; for example, the imperial system, which is rarely used, is employed to determine the thickness of its armor plating. Even if this issue seems easy to fix, converting the measurements into our superior metric system has proven troublesome. Despite these drawbacks, our TU-4 only weighs about 340 kg more than its American counterpart. With a maximum speed of 558 km/h at 10,250 m of height, 5,400 km of range, the ability to hold 6 x 1,000 kg bombs, and an offensive armament of 10 × 23 mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 aircraft cannons and 2 x KS-1 Komet standoff missiles, it is truly a technological marvel.

Lenin understood that to achieve true socialism, one must first have capitalism to provide the base (which can later be removed.) Joseph Stalin abolished this policy in 1928. However, we have decided a return to the NEP is required, given the slow movement of our government away from authoritarianism, and it should be put in place soon.

This collectivisation of peasants into kolkhozy, or large collective farms, works together with the expansion of the industrial base. \n\nWe received great benefits from this effort: we produced cheap grain to feed urban workers, surplus grain was exported, and many kulaks were deported to Siberia. As a result, it may be beneficial to continue Stalin's 'hard line' for all its positives. We shall proceed with and even double our efforts in the grouping of peasants. Those who express discontent will be declared kulaks and either executed or sent to labour camps. The Law of Three Spikelets, passed in 1932 for the punishment of resisters, shall be enforced with far greater vigour. \n\nYet at the same time, discontent in rural areas has skyrocketed. Mass famines in Ukraine and Kazakhstan started in 1932 are leading to millions of deaths.

However, recent tensions rising throughout the globe have called for a reconsideration of foreign policy, to name a few- Japan’s aggressions in the East, and the rising extremism in Europe in the West all bear bad news for the nascent socialist movements in the regions. After thorough discussions at the top hierarchy of the VKP(b) it has been decided to wilfully ignore the Kellogg-Briand Pact and its articles.

Most importantly, such a fleet would manifest us as the sole rulers of the Baltic Sea, giving us the means to fend off enemy incursions into our home waters while also allowing us to fight through potential blockades and breakthrough into the Atlantic.\n\nFurthermore, we should not neglect the political aspect of a proud navy, which serves as a reliable propaganda symbol and a tool to influence countries abroad."

 SOV_Morskoy_Bombardirovshchik_desc: "While the practice of using bombers against naval targets is nothing new to both the Airforce and the Navy, we still lack experience and suitable aircraft for the task of launching planes from Aircraft Carriers, which poses a great hindrance to our plans for the construction of a great Soviet Carrier Fleet.\n\nTo correct this mistake, it has been decided to design an entirely new naval bomber, specifically designed to operate under the difficult conditions that starting and landing on an aircraft carrier demands, meaning that this design has to be relatively light and compact, while still being to carry a large bomb or torpedo. Already several foreign aircraft firms have been contacted to assist our engineers in the design and construction process, while the Soviet Naval Aviation program has already begun the selection and training process for the future pilots of the new Soviet Carrier force."

 SOV_Chapaev_Light_Cruisers: "Chapayev Light Cruisers"
 SOV_Chapaev_Light_Cruisers_desc: "To further advance our recent naval reforms, the Soviet Navy has begun plans for the construction of up to seventeen new cruisers, which will eventually replace the still relatively new Kirov class cruisers. These cruisers, named Chapayev class after Vasily Chapayev, a Russian soldier and hero of the civil war, will still be based on the design of the Kirov-class, however with greatly improved armaments.\n\nThe 4 triple 152 mm gun turrets will greatly improve the general firepower of the ship, while improved amour ensures that the cruiser will be able to survive even the most brutal naval engagement. Furthermore, the cruisers will be equipped with the newest machinery and engines, while a new revolutionary unit system of boiler and engine rooms, will ensure that the Chapayev-class will remain a relevant force for quite a while."

 SOV_Submarine_Revolution: "Submarine Revolution"
 SOV_Submarine_Revolution_desc: "Submarines have been a constant in Naval Warfare for over 20 years now with almost every Navy fielding multiple submarines alongside their normal surface fleet.However, there are few people and even fewer nations, which have recognized the potential of the submarine as a devastating naval force, rather than a support branch of the main fleet.\n\nShould the USSR continue on its way towards becoming a dominant naval power, it is most imperative that we don't regress into the reactionary tactics of Battleships and pitched naval battles, instead choosing to become masters of the sea by enacting a true submarine revolution.\n\nStriking from beneath the waves our submarines will become the true hunters of the sea, stalking the enemy the second they enter, slowly chipping away at their strength one torpedo at the time, only to reemerge should the situation become unfavourable.\n\nTruly, with the strength of the people and the industry of Russia behind it, the Soviet submarine flotillas will be the nail in the coffin for the bourgeois surface navy of old!"

 SOV_Sovetsky_Soyuz_Super_Dreadnoughts_desc: "Even though the Red Fleet has made considerable progress on its journey to reform itself into a modern surface fleet, ready to challenge the navies of our probable adversaries there are still some elements missing to cement the dominance of the workers over our waters.\nTo challenge the new battleships constructed by Germany and Britain, who outclass our current battleships in both armor, firepower, and general combat capabilities. To offset this dangerous disbalance the Politburo has approved and ordered the construction of up to fifteen battleships of the new Sovetsky Soyuz-class.\nEquipped with nine 406mm guns, a variety of secondary armaments, and improved armor, these 269,4m long and 67000t heavy behemoths will be able to get into a direct brawl with the strongest battleships fielded by our enemies and win the engagement with a high probability.\nWhile the construction of these Super Dreadnoughts will certainly be expensive and time-consuming, their presence alone will force the enemy to avoid the Soviet Navy, ensuring our naval dominance for years to come."

 SOV_Kronshtadt_Battle_Cruisers: "“Kronstadt” Battle Cruisers"
 SOV_Kronshtadt_Battle_Cruisers_desc: "Much like any area of life it also holds for our Navy- that need truly is the mother of invention. Starting long before the Great War the navies of the world have been locked in a perpetual state of competition with each new ship being designed and built to outperform the old designs of the enemy, become obsolete by new enemy ships, and then quietly retire into the history books.\n\nTo play our part in this natural evolution the Soviet Navy High Command has set up specifications for a new cruiser design, to counter the cruisers of the enemy, especially cruisers built under the Second London Naval Treaty and the new German pocket battleships.\n\nTo accomplish this we have commissioned the construction of new cruisers, displacing roughly 39.660t and carrying six 380mm guns, these battlecruisers are designed to outperform and destroy Treaty cruisers, while also being able to hold their own against smaller enemy battleships."

 SOV_Black_Sea_Young_School_desc: "With the reforms in the Red Navy going as planned, the time has come to integrate our planned doctrinal changes into the greater command structure of the Navy.\n\nTo accomplish this, the Navy High Command has signed off on the creation of the „Black Sea Young School“ a Military academy for new navy officers. In this academy, the new generation of officers will be trained to act and fight according to the new Soviet Naval doctrine, while also checking them for political compatibility and reliability with our socialist ideals, with Political Commissars educating the new generation of officers.\n\nOnce they finish their education this new generation of officers will be integrated into the already existing command structure of fleets, naval bases, and ships from where they will spread the new doctrine throughout the entire fleet, undermining “reactionary” old guard officers if necessary and ultimately replacing the old-guard entirely."

 SOV_Sevastopol_Krepost_desc: "A good defence is a good offence or at least a good enough one. While we have built a sizable Navy, we cannot fully rely upon its might to safeguard the Motherland. Thus, it is imperative that we build forts to protect the vital city of Sevastapol.\n\nIf any of our enemies take this crucial City, our trade and supply will be severely impacted, so keeping this Coastal City safe from any invasions from the Sea is a necessity to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands."

 SOV_Morskaya_Pekhota_desc: "A Navy to grace the tough seas, to slice through water like butter and rain hellfire to our enemies, is a great asset to the Revolutionary cause. However, an infantry force will benefit from the recent expansion and modernization of our navy.\n\nA Russian marine force, the Morskaya Pekhota, has existed since the 17th century and it has evolved over the years with advances in Naval tech. It would certainly benefit the Soviet Army to utilize these elite marines and bolster our amphibious forces. "

 SOV_Pacific_Military_School: "Pacific Military School"
 SOV_Pacific_Military_School_desc: "Through our efforts, we have built a mighty Sea-Faring Fleet, comprised of Battleships and Cruisers, but our personnel are inexperienced in handling these vessels. A Pacific, Blue-Ocean Fleet like ours is good by itself in sheer number and firepower, but it also needs capable personnel to man our ships and dominates our enemies.\n\nThus, the Navy has suggested a Pacific Naval Academy, meant to train our Seamen into mean, Red fighting machines on the dangerous and rewarding Pacific waves."

 SOV_Aviation_Cult_desc: "As part of the "Positive Heroism" being promoted in Soviet society to uplift individuals who have committed heroic actions that have advanced the cause of socialism, the same will be true of our brave fighter pilots.\n\nState media will connect aviation to relevant themes from traditional folklore, making our aviators into noble knights doing battle in the sky. By publicizing their daring exploits, we hope to make aviation more relatable and accessible to the Soviet citizen at home, encouraging enlistment and heightening morale."

 SOV_Solve_the_Shell_Hunger_desc: "Though the factories of the Soviet Union may produce enough rifles to arm each man, woman, and child in Russia, everyone will sit silent and useless without ammunition. The Tsarist government learned this lesson well during the Great War, where they squandered proletariat lives by the thousands.\n\nSeeing this, Comrade Stalin has prioritized the development of the munitions industry, ordering construction on several new factories across the union. As well as increasing production, the Red Army logistical corps will overhaul the existing systems that supply our frontline soldiers. While the tactical and strategic doctrines of the Red Army continue to evolve, in the end, one thing will remain consistent- the demand for shells, be it for the artillery guns or the standard riflemen."

 SOV_BT_Cavalry_Tanks: "BT Cavalry Tanks"
 SOV_BT_Cavalry_Tanks_desc: "Among the several categories of tanks envisaged by Red Army tacticians, one prominent one is the fast "Bystrokhodny" Tank, abbreviated to BT. Mimicking the horse cavalry of the last century, these swift and lightly armored tanks will be committed after the initial breakthrough has been achieved, during the exploitation phase.\n\nUtilizing the Christie suspension, designed by the American engineer of the same name, allows for considerably longer movement than conventional leaf spring systems and enables the tank to reach impressive cross-country speeds. These vehicles would effectively fill the role of a "Cavalry" tank, using their mobility to harass enemy forces and prevent them from reorganizing."

 SOV_Multi_Turreted_Tanks: "Multi-Turreted Tanks"
 SOV_Multi_Turreted_Tanks_desc: "Despite being considered "impractical" by many, a multi-turreted tank design offers several enticing possibilities.\n\nMoving in tandem with the infantry, such tanks could engage multiple targets simultaneously, provide moving cover for ground troops, and strike fear into the enemy- all traits that could be especially useful during the breakthrough phase of an offensive operation.\n\nSeveral design bureaus have extensively tinkered with this concept, and a few have produced promising prototypes. With our approval, production of these slow-moving metal monstrosities could begin immediately."

 SOV_Peoples_Commissariat_of_Defense_desc: "Plagued by incompetence, nepotism, and red tape, the People's Commissariat for Military and Naval Affairs has proven an ineffective institution. While the Kremlin has long dedicated itself chiefly to economic and agricultural concerns, developments abroad have caused the party to take a long hard look at our command structure.\n\nWhile its role and mission have mostly remained the same as its predecessor, the newly created Commissariat of Defense's streamlined requisition process will allow it to perform its duties more effectively than the previous system."

Now, we should begin a large-scale reconstruction in an effort to restore this crucial part of our navy to its former glory. We should also build new dockyards in the Crimea and expand our Sevastopol Port.

It is currently small, weak, and unable to contest the Rising Sun. Therefore, more resources have been allocated to M. Viktorov, the commander of this fleet. We will start constructions in the Transamur area immediately, and we will develop the Vladivostok port to outmatch even the ports of Tokyo. Soon, none will be able to challenge our hold on the Pacific."

 SOV_Naval_Infantry_desc: "Our brave Marines have defended our homeland for centuries. During the Napoleonic Wars, our naval infantry defended our West. During the Russo-Japanese War, they defended our East. During the Crimean War, they defended the South. More resources should be spent for these brave men. New tactics should be developed so they can fight better. New equipment should be research so they can fight harder. Our budget more then compensates for this project, so let's use it to make sure our Morskaya Pekhota get what they need."

 SOV_Reorganize_the_Red_Army: "Reorganize the Red Army"
 SOV_Reorganize_the_Red_Army_desc: "In the immediate postwar era, the chaotic state of the Soviet economy has precluded the expense of a large standing army. The majority of the divisions are understrength and rely upon reservists drawn from particular territorial regions.\n\nA combination of regular cadre formations and territorial militias, poor organization limits the Red Army's capabilities as a combat-capable force. As it has become clear that the military will play an important role in Soviet foreign policy, either as an enforcer or deterrent, it is of the utmost importance that the Red Army immediately be reorganized following set professional standards and a coherent mission policy."

 SOV_Defense_in_Depth: "Defense in Depth"
 SOV_Defense_in_Depth_desc: "The key to victory is the effective utilization of all available assets at hand. Men, equipment, and terrain are all assets to consider, resources to spend on the battlefield.\n\nOne asset we have in abundance is territory- our lands are vast, giving our forces room to maneuver and the ability to conduct repeated retreats should it be necessary.\n\nTo utilize our geography to its full potential, Red Army theorists envisage a "defense in depth" involving fortifications, field works, and military units arranged in consecutive strategic belts to slow the enemy advance. As the enemy pushes through the frontlines and penetrates further, their flanks become vulnerable; when the advance stalls and they are overextended, mobile reserves can be brought from the rear and used to envelop the enemy penetrations."

Prototypes of the aircraft show great promise, but existing models lack refinement and exhibit several minor flaws that could be dangerous in combat scenarios.\n\nThe SB incorporates numerous cutting-edge innovations such as a modern stressed skin, which allows for a lighter construction with a similar load-carrying ability of the structure to other aircraft utilizing different construction methods. The Tupolev SB also features a broad and high aspect ratio wing, which will give it a good altitude performance- a trait that has proven extremely useful in bombing missions."

Perhaps, this needs no longer be the case… Soviet ingenuity has led to daring new missions in which brave pioneers are venturing into the unknown once more, as previous generations did in the 17th century with the conquest of Siberia. One of these pioneers, the pilot Valery Chkalov, will embark on a non-stop transpolar flight, from Moscow to Washington state. If successful, this flight marks the beginning of a new age in Soviet aviation and paves the way for future aeronautical accomplishments. It would also present a fine opportunity for propaganda."

As so, it's damaging our armed force's efficiency and organization. As tension gets higher between us and the Japanese imperialists and as the capitalist United States expands their influence in Asia, this position of unpreparedness is intolerable. Therefore, the high command has ordered the founding of a dedicated Pacific military school in Vladivostok."

Mechanised and armored divisions are too expensive to be produced in mass scale and just some of them are perfectly equipped and ready-to-fight: therefore, they are useless. In one way or another, it comes up that men are our main resource and therefore that men shall be our army’s main pillar.

This may mean they are researching possible applications of this science and have found enough that they are not keen to let the rest of the world know. Georgii Flerov has addressed a secret leader to (get leader name) on this topic, and it has convinced the Premier to devote additional resources to it. He has also chosen Igor Kurchatov, a scientist at the Soviet Academy of Sciences who is known for his experience in nuclear physics, to develop whatever comes of his research.

The use of rocket engines offers a whole new range of possibilities, in terms of their use in for strategic bomber operations, as well as a potential delivery method for a nuclear payload. Furthermore, rocket engines can be used for civilian and scientific purposes, as aviation techniques modernize, humanity is becoming closer and closer to pushing our limits beyond our atmosphere.

Following this standard, the aviation abilities of the nation must be dual roled as well. Factories equipped to handle aluminum and other light metals will also be made capable of military aircraft production.\n\nIn times of war, Soviet military doctrine calls for military aircraft to be deployed en-masse in support of our ground forces. These support missions would force our planes to fly dangerously low, and they will need to be well-armed and armored to perform their job effectively.

However, even today, our enemy races towards us in tanks and cars while our military trudges through the snow. This is a problem that cripples our military effectiveness, and we can no longer depend on numbers to triumph in the changing landscape of modern warfare. Our military leadership offers a solution: a campaign to fully equip our army with the latest vehicles to ferry them to and from the battlefield. It will tax our resources and sap our budget, but it will ensure our troops can't be outmaneuvered and trapped in a pocket. Now, that would be bad."

The “Tactical” Deep Battle will act as the steps from which operational leaps are assembled, and go on to influence the larger military strategy.\n\nThrough careful maneuvering and a set of objectives to complete, this theory will be put into practice, involving combined arms, and maneuverable formation. The Rifle Corps, assisted by the Artillery of the Red Army and the aerial assets of the VVS will punch through enemy lines to break the opposing force’s tactical zones at the point of contact. In this approach, the order of battle will encompass three echelons: one to meet the enemy head-on, the second to support the breakthrough, and the third to flank and tie down the enemy.

The tank was originally developed in the Great War by the British and turned out to be crucial to defeating the Germans. To keep up with the times we must develop our own tank programs but potentially the developments can be made with a slightly more ‘Soviet’ touch. Our recent industrial expansion has left us with a monstrous capacity to produce these armored war machines. Maybe our efforts against the Germans may be better spent in the mobilization of an unstoppable wave of T-34s or potentially we should focus our time on the development of a smaller number of heavy tanks.

 SOV_Concentrated_Artillery_Barrages_desc: "An artillery barrage is, put simply, shooting at a line of targets continuously. It's effective both offensively and defensively, as this forces the defenders to abandon their position, and it prevents the attackers from entering an area. Due to this, the barrage has been an important tactic in the Great War. Yet there is still room for improvement.\n\nSome of the prominent generals in the Red Army suggest that we combine it with concentrated fire. Instead of shooting in a line, our artillery shall unleash their ordnance on certain targets. It's logical, why should our soldiers fire at nothing when they could aim right for our foes? No enemy fort can ever outlast our continuous rain of death."

The Japanese employed it on our artillery during the Siege of Port Arthur, to disastrous results and immense loss of life. We now adopt the same method, however horrible it may be.

Instead of penetrating enemy lines in a single deep battle, large penetrations and exploitations to an operational depth of up to 100 kilometers or more will aim to neutralize all enemy defenses to the maximum possible depth. Once our troops break the line, mobile units will enter the gap to attack rear positions and prevent the opposing force from reorganizing.\n\nThe essence of such a deep operation will be to use modern weapons to envelop and destroy the enemy's entire front line in a single blow."

This reactionary way of thought is everything we abhor in our society, and we must purge it.\n\nHowever, women aren’t able to gain full rights as men, specifically because they wouldn’t have anyone to take care of their children.

 SOV_Abolish_System_of_Rationing_desc: "The last decade was marked by severe food shortages across the entire nation due to the disastrous Great War and the chaotic civil war that followed, which severely affected agricultural production. The first five-year plan also resulted in an enormous increase in urban labour who also needed to be fed. At the time we saw it fit to introduce a rationing system, otherwise, we would have had to watch our citizens starve. Bread, sugar, butter, meat and eggs were given in limited quantities to our workers to make sure they lived to see another day and remained productive members of the state.\n\nThe need for such a system has declined in the last few years. As agricultural production has improved to some extent and the number of people in need of food was recently reduced, a gradual phase-out of the rationing system has been going on for some time. With the removal of some goods and the increase in price for others, the population has seen the writing on the wall and adapted accordingly.

As part of the wider agrarian reforms undertook by Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin prior to the First World War, these self-contained farms were intended to boost the agricultural production of the Russian Empire by encouraging privatization and competition between individual farmsteads. A failure even at its height, they accounted for less than eight per cent of the farm output before the bourgeoisie fell before the might of the workers.\n\nFollowing the civil war, attempts were made to include them in the collective farms, but the weakness of our central government and their relative isolation has made the task impossible to accomplish at the time.\n\nAs a result of this, hundreds of thousands of khutors still remain all over the nation, especially in the western and central parts, where our presence is felt less.

These MTS would supply the collective farms with the machinery and people needed to run it in exchange for ‘natural payment’, that being agricultural products. As an added bonus, since the stations would be financed and owned by the state, this would also give us a degree of control over the agricultural sector.\n\nFollowing their introduction, we have seen a significant increase in farming output, and with the ever-expanding number of Kolkhozes comes to a greater need for MTS.

In exchange for a certain amount of work, a worker receives either payment or, most commonly, food products such as grain. This system ensures that the people toiling on the Kolkhozes are given their share of the production based on merit alone.\n\nHowever, can all work be treated the same? After all, is the unskilled worker as important as a tractor operator? Our answer is no.\n\nAs the industrial centres expand, and the number of mouths needed to sustain their growth increases, we shall divert more of the agricultural output to the cities, whilst making sure that the farmers receive their share based on their qualification. A tractor operator will receive two day’s worth of products for one day of work, and an unskilled labourer will have to work for two days to earn for one. It is only fair, after all."

It would be false to say that we lack oil, in fact, we possess a great deal of it. Not even taking into consideration the doubling of production during the first five-year plan, one would think that we do not need any alternatives. They would be wrong.\n\nSynthetic oil, while most commonly known as a substitute for petroleum, presents advantages that the usual fuel does not possess. Not only is it more chemically stable, but it also serves as resistance to oxidation and thermal breakdown. With superior protection against deposit formation in the engine prolonging its life and the increase of fuel efficiency, we have many reasons to encourage its production. Besides, having as much oil as possible never hurts.\n\nOne large disadvantage that it possesses, however, is that it is expensive to create. While its costs will reduce as we further develop the necessary technology, we will have to be satisfied with starting production on a small scale for now."

By working, our workers show their support for our revolution! If they don't work as well as we need them to, that must mean they don't support our country enough, and therefore they're not needed. It will surely motive our industrial workers even more, as we all work for a socialist utopia!"

 SOV_Vocational_Training_Reform_desc: "Industry isn't all just quantity, in order to build a truly efficient workforce we must provide them with the tools and education necessary to work the best they can. Both the skilled and unskilled workers of our nation will be able to reach out to the local government and party functionaries in order to opt into our education programs.\n\nFurthermore, entire factories will be enrolled involuntarily in order to make sure they handle our key industries with care. Soon, as our industrial capacity expands, we will be sure that our output is of the highest quality possible for our mass production centred economy."

We cannot realistically expect to meet the industrial and commercial output expected to maintain growth without adding the stick for our workers.\n\nWe have made actions already to improve the quality of work, as well as grant more free time, those were the carrot. As for the stick, we will introduce significant criminal punishments for those who fail to do their tasks as workers, this will help improve the quality of our industry and keep laziness out of our workers' paradise in the making. Hopefully, these measures will only prove to be temporary but their necessity is obvious in times of peace and emergency."

In many of our steel mills, this process is still done manually. The procedure shall be mechanized to increase tremendously the amount of the precious resource created. If properly modernized, our mills could achieve even higher production quotas, making the Motherland richer.\n\nAll the extra steel could be utilized to expand the Red Army. More tanks, weapons, and artillery guns would be made every day, which would result in more victories for the Union."

As to what Lenin himself declared, "Berlin is the centre of Europe." Whoever controls Berlin, controls the entire continent. So, with the help of the revolution, we will liberate all the continent's enslaved peoples! Fascists, capitalists, all of Russia's adversaries. And, according to Eurasian beliefs, we are truly unique: all of Europe and Asia belong to the motherlands!\n\nFirst, we should keep small countries just outside our domains of influence, such as Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, in mind. Following that, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia would be realistic choices.

Well, now it is the time to let them know that their silly little dreams end here! We must put all of our resources and manpower, all of our blood and our sweat towards defending the motherland, and defend every inch of our land no matter the cost! Every strike of a hammer in the factories must be a strike for victory, and every shot fired by a gun must be a shot well aimed! The enemy will give no mercy, so we must show none either! And when the fascist creatures are bloodied and bruised, we will push them out and all the way back to the hole that they call Berlin! There can be no peace until we achieve total victory! Uraa!"

Its motto calls for "the great transformation of nature" (or великое преобразование природы), referring to the introduction and implementation of new land development, agricultural practices and water projects in order to improve the agricultural sector throughout the nation.\n\nThese include the planting and construction of gigantic networks of shelterbelts ("forest strips" or лесополоса), the introduction of grassland crop rotation and the construction of ponds, reservoirs & irrigation canals to ensure highly sustainable crop yields. This project has been well received, though there have been some discerning reports about the "nest method" of plantation. However, they are secondary activities in purview of the much larger project. As we embark on this campaign for the national good, we develop the Motherland, & in the words of the General Secretary Stalin \"defeat drought\"."

Experts have already handed over several secret reports to Moscow, that predict that “if the problems regarding the agricultural sector of both the Kazakh and Ukrainian SSRs are not solved with utmost urgency, these areas will lose approximately 25 to 40% of their population, 75% of their livestock, 40% of their economic potential and their remaining loyalty to both the Soviet Union and the guidance of comrade Stalin.“ So far the leadership of the Soviet Union hasn't formulated a plan in combatting the critical situation, but it is clear that something must be done to prevent the Ukrainian and Kazakh workers from abandoning the Union."

 SOV_Deficient_Economy_4_desc: "While the first five year plans have been largely successful in transforming the Soviet Union from a primitive agrarian nation to a modern, industrial world global power, which is perfectly able to stand up to the economies of the western reactionaries in both size and production output, there are still a variety of inefficiencies preventing the Soviet Union from becoming the perfect example of an effective socialist economy.\n\nBut despite the progress reported and achieved by the Politburo, it is undeniable that exactly this rapid expansion has created a variety of problems, that have put a lid on the general efficiency of our economy through both uncoordinated planning and lackluster modernization efforts, while both bureaucratic obstacles and red tape have been growing rapidly since the start of the five-year plans. While these problems are definitely not overly dramatic and unsolvable, it will still need a large amount of work and optimization to fix these issues and finally make the Soviet economy a force to be reckoned with."
