###  Spanish Political Events
 Spain_Elections.1.t: "The Popular Front Forms"
 Spain_Elections.1.d: "With the elections on the horizon and the socialists gaining momentum in our nation, they intend on using it as a means to gain a foothold in the nation’s parliament once more. As such, they’ve created a coalition of various left wing political parties and organizations called the Popular Front. This so-called Popular Front aims to revert all changes made by the CEDA-RRP and establish their own mindset of the Republic into a reality. This coalition aims to destroy the very fabric of our nation, and they intend to pervert the Spanish identity to something that suits a socialist revolution. We shall not yield to these socialist terrorists, and we must exert all political efforts into countering their victory in the elections."
 Spain_Elections.1.A: "The left finds strength in numbers"
 
 Spain_Elections.2.t: "1936 General Election"
 Spain_Elections.2.d: "The General Elections are here, and at an inopportune time. Violence and Civil Unrest have become the norms that the Spanish people have to endure, with violence from both the left and right mounting in both size and violence everyday. This was recently shown in Catalonia, where the largest riot seen in our young republic’s history has occurred here today. Today’s election isn’t just any election, but it is quintessential to the survival of our republic and its uncertain future. Given with the increasing popularity of the Popular Front, it is no surprise that they were the victors in this election, garnering a majority in parliament. This victory is a serious blow to the right wing parties and factions in Spain, but this is merely a temporary setback, for they have prepared measures to enforce their rule over Spain…"
 Spain_Elections.2.A: "The Popular Front Wins!"

 Spain_Politics.1.t: "Political killings"
 Spain_Politics.1.d: "Ever since the victory of the Popular Front in February, the Falange Española, a small, marginal political force, has received an avalanche of young right-wing militants willing to take violent action. This has provoked the response of similar left-wing organizations. Last Thursday, 12th of March, the first attack has taken place against Luis Jiménez de Asúa, father of the 1931 constitution and socialist MP. Although he has come out safe, his police escort has lost his life. The government has responded today by outlawing the party and arresting its leader, José Antonio Primo de Rivera. In the following months, the street violence will cause more than fifty dead among the left-wing organizations, as well as some forty Falangists. Around a hundred churches and monasteries will also be assaulted and burned, its contents looted by the far left militias."
 Spain_Politics.1.A: "We're losing control"
 SPR_Political_Killings: "Political Killings"
 
 Spain_Politics.2.t: "Niceto Alcalá-Zamora removed from power"
 Spain_Politics.2.d: "After the elections in February 1936, the president of the Republic Niceto Alcalá-Zamora has found himself in a difficult position. The left wing has not forgotten his attitude during the previous government, and a debate has been started in parliament about their dissolution by order of the President in 1933. According to the new government, this was an anti-constitutional act and Alcalá-Zamora must be destituted. The vote has resulted in 238 votes in favor, 5 against and 174 blanks, from right-wing MPs who abandoned the room in protest. Despite his protests, he has been forced to step down. The post will be taken up by Diego Martínez Barrio, president of Parliament as an interim president."
 Spain_Politics.2.A: "He was never one of us"
 
 Spain_Politics.3.t: "Manuel Azaña steps into power"
 Spain_Politics.3.d: "Last 30th of April, Manuel Azaña was elected as the only candidate to the Presidency of the Republic of the Popular Front. Today, after the destitution of Alcalá-Zamora, he has been voted in as President with 754 of 874 votes in favor."
 Spain_Politics.3.A: "Alright"
 
 Spain_Politics.4.t: "The Assassination of Calvo Sotelo"
 Spain_Politics.4.d: "Yesterday, 12th of July, Lieutenant José Castillo of the Assault Guard, socialist militant, was shot dead, either by Falangist gunmen or members of the Carlist Tercio de Requetés de Madrid. After his funeral, a group of his friends and supporters met in the Pontejos Barracks, including several police officers of the Assault Guard, socialist militants, Civil Guards and many members of ‘La Motorizada’, a Popular Front-controlled socialist paramilitary group made out of socialist police officers. Many among this group demanded revenge for this assassination, and several trucks were dispatched to seek out known Falangists. One of the said trucks, led by Captain Fernando Condés of the Civil Guard, was unable to find any Falangists, so they instead decided to take their revenge on leaders of the parliamentary opposition. Antonio Goicoechea, the leader of Renovación Española, was not in his house, and Gil Robles, the leader of CEDA, was away on vacations. Early this morning, finding themselves close to the house of Calvo Sotelo, leader of the monarchist parliamentary opposition, the group entered the apartment and arrested Calvo Sotelo, who protested invoking his parliamentary immunity but was calmed by Condés identifying himself as a member of the Civil Guard. After promising his family he would call them as soon as he got to wherever they would take him “unless these gentlemen are taking me to shoot me”, he climbed in the truck and was taken away. His body has been found this morning next to a cemetery, shot twice and thrown on the ground, on a pool of blood."

###  Spanish 1936 Start Date Events
 Spain.101.t: "The 2nd Republic"
 Spain.101.d: "Only two years before, the king, Alfonso XII, was ousted from power and permanently exiled, a new republic proclaimed and a a new constitution introduced. A new era of prosperity and reform was envisioned by the lower classes and the moderate bourgeoisie, yet opposition was looming. The provisional government of Niceto Alcalá-Zamora was replaced in october of 1931 by one headed by the liberal reformist Manuel Azaña, who had envisioned great reforms for a country limping behind its european contemporaries. Men and women were given universal suffrage, divorce was legalised, 10000 schools were opened, religios orders were prohibited from teaching, expropriation of land lords. etc. Yet at its very beggining the young republic suffered its first obstacles, most of the right wing parties, deeply catholic, were disgusted at the reforms, accusing the state of wanting to destroy the catholic church, and with the autonomy status of Catalonia, the integrity of Spain itself. With the army reforms, which plan to modernise the spanish army by shrinking its size and reducing the excessive officer core, the republic gains yet another enemy. In august of 1932 a badly organised and weak coup d'état is launched by the general Sanjurjo. Further instability is exacerbated by the economic downturn of the great depression, of which Spain wasn't excempt. All put together, already from the start of its existence the 2nd republic has been plagued with social and economic instabilty, a fierce hatred between rich and poor, reformist and traditionalist, catholic and anti-clericalist, the future remains uncertain and black clouds have begun to gather over Spain, what will happen next?"
 Spain.101.A: "República, siempre República"
 
 Spain.102.t: "Azana Resigns"
 Spain.102.d: "At this very moment, we are faced with mounting pressure from all sides of the political spectrum. Left and Right wing parties have condemned our so-called “inadequate policies and slothful policymaking” that they have already taken efforts to utilize the public as a political weapon in their struggle. Our leadership is now under crisis, with the public taking our legitimacy to the streets, with violence erupting in major cities and rallies becoming a frequent sight in the Cortes, the nation’s parliament. What’s worse, is that a vote of confidence against our leadership is under threat thanks to the inadequacies of our Prime Minister. Perhaps it is best that we pressure him into sending his letter of resignation, that way in the end, we at least have one less problem to worry about. Now, let’s just hope that we make the right decision in the first place…"
 Spain.102.A: "He anticipates the results"
 
 Spain.103.t: "1933 General Election"
 Spain.103.d: "Due to the untimely resignation of our Prime Minister, we have declared a dissolution of parliament, calling for fresh elections that will be quintessential in deciding the fate of our young republic. Already, the Left and the Right have taken up all available measures into coercing our public into voting for their respective bloc. In the end, it was the coalition of the Confederacion Espanola de Derechas Autónomas or CEDA and the Radical Republican Party as the sole victor in the general elections. This coalition is considered by many as a right-wing coalition, as it follows conservative policies and advocates a Catholic based society. The Left condemns this victory, for they state that it will empower the established elite and oppresses minorities and workers in the society. While it may be a victory for today, it may lead to serious consequences down the line."
 Spain.103.A: "Victoria para la derecha"
 
 Spain.104.t: "The Leftists leave the Government"
 Spain.104.d: "In a seemingly act of protest against the new government, the leftist bloc have walked out of the government, stating their opposition to the new coalition of right wing and centre right parties. They claim that they intend on bringing about a reinforced status quo, one based off oppression and reactionary policies, and they call for all concerned citizens to take a stand against the new government. While this allows us easier passage of legislation, the fact that the leftists have not only left the government, but call for condemnation against our regime, it spreads a sense of rattled confidence in our government and may serve as a precedent of civil unrest in the near future."
 Spain.104.A: "At least we scared the bastards!"
 
 Spain.105.t: "Revolutionary Strikes!"
 Spain.105.d: "Months after the Leftists have left the government, our fellow workers have declared strikes across the entirety of the republic, as they’re convinced by the leftist rhetoric of the current government and are using this to exert pressure on it. This so-called “revolutionary strikes’ have taken a toll on our economy, which is already deteriorating thanks to economic depression and political upheaval. As such, it is of paramount importance that we deal with these strikes immediately, regardless of how controversial such methods are, for they have sealed their fate upon themselves…"
 Spain.105.A: "Punish these Traitors!"
 
 Spain.106.t: "Asturian Organized Coal Strike"
 Spain.106.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]With revolutionary strikes at manageable levels, we thought that we saw the last of these socialist malcontents. We were very wrong, as the autonomous region of Asturias showed us. Asturias contains one of the most significant coal deposits in the peninsula, and with such role, holds significant economic importance. The Socialists were well aware of its significance, and have coerced and influenced the miners in the region to organize a regional coal strike. These strikes however, were violent, as clashes between local government and the strikers were unprecedented, prompting us to send the army to quell it. While we quelled it successfully, and the strikers went back to work, albeit forcefully, the fact that such strike escalated into a clash have shown how far the Socialist threat is entrenched, and it is of great importance that the army will quell this crisis as soon as possible."
 Spain.106.A: "Punish these Traitors!"
 
 Spain.107.t: "Straperlo Affair"
 Spain.107.d: "One of the many flaws of our young republic is the rampant corruption that has taken up root here, as evident in the Straperlo Affair. Here, various government officials including the Prime Minister, Alejandro Lerroux, were implicated of supposedly taking up bribes and influence peddling to his nephew in return for legalizing a certain version of roulette. To the ordinary citizen, this shows that corruption in government can truly be brought to justice, and that no one is higher than the law. However, the fact that Lerroux was the leader of the Radical Republican Party, one of the parties in the coalition, it is not surprising that the coalition collapsed in an instant, and that it leaves the political system weakened and incapable of suppressing the ever growing socialists."
 Spain.107.A: "The corrupt must leave!"
 
 Spain.108.t: "Divisions within the Right"
 Spain.108.d: "Ever since the Straperlo Affair, division and polarization amongst the right wing factions of our government are frequent, with various factions supporting one side over the other. Such political bickering allows for gridlock in politics, something that we need to avoid given the fact that our nation is on the brink of a civil war. As such, the various right wing factions of government have came to a compromise, they shall install Manuel Portela Valladares as their PM of Spain, given his good reputation in the political scene. This should hopefully give some stability in politics and allow our government to move forward in dealing with contentious issues such as the potential civil war on the horizon."

 Spain.1.A: "Confide in our Progress"
 Spain.1.B: "We need to make stronger changes and promises now!"
 
 Spain.2.t: "Leftist Prisoners Released"
 Spain.2.d: "With the unfortunate rise of the Popular Front’s popularity in Spanish politics, it has opened the floodgates to political power, giving them indirect influence over our government’s policies since if we anger them, we anger the people. If we anger the people, the powder keg of our republic will finally spark and engulf the Iberian Peninsula. This was inevitably shown in the arrest of political prisoners, mostly socialists and communists alike. These leftists were able to contact their associates in the Popular Front, and have now started a nationwide protest for the release of these prisoners. These prisoners are the living epitome of what we abhor in politics, but faced with mounting pressure, we have no choice but to release them. This is a victory for the Popular Front, but it is a major defeat for the already fragile coalition that’s on the brink of collapse."

 Spain.4.t: "Catalonia Explodes"
 Spain.4.d: "With the victory of the Popular Front in the release of their fellow comrades, they have decided to be more ambitious in their efforts to pressure the government into submission, and it worked. Today in Catalonia, one of the most prosperous regions of the republic, violence and civil unrest has engulfed it, with rioting and looting a common sight in the area. This is inevitably shown in Barcelona, the heart of the socialist violence, with clashes between government forces and protestors increasing in strength and ferocity, with the scene having parallels to a warzone. This shows the world and our government the true scale of the situation we’re dealing with, and it is necessary that we use all options on the table, regardless of the violence. After all, these socialists have shown no mercy to our light hand, maybe it is time that we use a stronger hand against them…"
 Spain.4.A: "Attempt to contain these fanatics!"
 
 Spain.6.t: "The Army and Fascists Consolidate"
 Spain.6.d: "With our victory against those decadent reactionaries and their co-conspirators, we have used our victory to consolidate our power and influence throughout the republic, ensuring that their rhetoric doesn’t get amplified on the streets of Madrid or any of our major cities. However, not all is fine for our revolution, for the reactionaries have a plan to counter it. While we were celebrating, numerous reports circulate that the Falangists and the military have met in secret, organizing plans and operations that will endanger our foothold over Spain. While we don’t have any minutes of the meeting or the list of members who were present there, it is clear that the military are condemning our revolution, and are taking steps to subvert and dismantle our current regime."
 Spain.6.A: "The Radical Right is organizing"

 Spain.8.t: "The Arrest of Primo de Rivera"
 Spain.8.d: "With the Falangists and the military cooperating and planning to overthrow the government, they have used various means to supply themselves of the necessary ammunition and weaponry needed to overthrow us. One of which is through Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera, one of the main leaders of the Falangists, wherein he smuggled firearms to his fellow party members and distribute them, arming themselves to counter resistance that may otherwise destroy their revolution. Thankfully, our fellow comrades got wind of this information, and have informed the proper authorities to seize these smuggled weaponry and destroy them, with some of our fellow comrades getting weapons of course. However, the fact that they have smuggled weaponry and are experienced, we must assume that this isn’t the only smuggling ring, and that the Falangists may already be well armed as we speak."
 Spain.8.A: "He is too dangerous"
 
 Spain.10.t: "May 1st Demonstrations"
 Spain.10.d: "May 1st is considered by many as International Workers’ Day, the day wherein our struggle for workers representation and rights are fully realized, the day wherein the workers voice can finally be heard loud and clearly amongst the people who oppress them. However this Labor Day event was no ordinary, for our fellow comrades have taken their struggles not only to the streets, but with rocks and broken pipes. The protestors were clashing with fellow protestors, specifically the Falange, who were there to protest our government’s policies and more radical nonsense. However, the Falangists came prepared, and they put up stiff resistance against both the protestors and our government forces, which lasted the entire day until they themselves got tired and left. This clash serves as a reminder of the disgruntled Falangists in our midst, and how a peaceful protest can turn into a bloody riot in an instant."
 Spain.10.A: "Spain is in danger!"
 
 Spain.12.t: "Mola Organizes Generals"
 Spain.12.d: "Unconfirmed reports circulate throughout our leadership stating that Emilio Mola, one of the prominent military figures involved in the plot, has recently organized our military leadership in a meeting in an unknown location. According to our sources, this meeting is extensive, and is allegedly a ploy used by the Falangists to recruit members of our military into their cause. This act done by the Nationalists is not only an attack against our rule, it is outright treason for they are overthrowing our government. As such, we will use whatever resources we have to contain or even cease all acts of rebellion and insurgency in our republic."
 Spain.12.A: "The officers are acting strange" 
 
 Spain.14.t: "The Death of Jose Castillo!"
 Spain.14.d: "Jose Castillo, a lieutenant in the Guardia de Asalto, the urban paramilitary arm of the Guardia Civil, was assassinated today by unknown individuals. While this would be a normal day in Spain, there is one small caveat left out, his political leanings. Even though Castillo was a member of the Guardia Civil which is conservative in nature, he was also a member of UMRA, an anti-fascist organization upon which he himself was a trainer. This organization is responsible for radicalizing our youth to becoming socialists and are training them into citizen militias. As such, we can speculate that the murderers were the Falangists. This assassination however will not sit well with the socialists, and we must expect that they will retaliate against this act."
 Spain.14.A: "¡Carajo! The left is furious!"
 
 Spain.16.t: "The Death of José Sotelo!"
 Spain.16.d: "In retaliation of the death of Jose Castillo, the socialists assassinated one of the prominent Falangists, Jose Sotelo. Sotelo, one of the radical right’s most prominent personalities, his rhetoric was more radical and more coercive than the rest of his colleagues that the socialists have deemed him a threat to their revolutionary struggle, and have assassinated him in retaliation of the death of their own. Sotelo’s death however may have not done anything but guarantee the conflict in the Iberian Peninsula, for the Falangists aren’t taking kindly to his death, and the military coup organized by Emilio Mola may have been fast-tracked in the wake of his death. Now, it is only a matter of time before the fires of war rage on in Madrid…"
 Spain.16.A: "¡Carajo! The right is furious!"
 
###  Spanish Civil War Events
 Spain_CW.0.t: "Spanish Military Revolts - Spain Plunged into Civil War"
 Spain_CW.0.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Dark news have come from the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nGeneral Emilio Mola, the chief organizer and commander of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces, and General José Sanjurjo, who served as a symbolic leader, today announced an open uprising against the wildly unpopular Republican government. Numerous conservative organizations, like as CEDA, monarchists, including the rival Alfonsists and the religiously conservative Carlists, as well as the fascist Falange Española de las JONS, supported the Nationalist movement.\n\nThe army's reduced funding, which made it more and more dissatisfied with the government, was the root of this uprising. Pamplona, Burgos, Zaragoza, Valladolid, Cádiz, Cordoba, Sevilla, and Spanish Morocco all saw the rise of military formations in support of the coup.\n\nAlthough this result is not unexpected given how visible the political unrest has gotten."

 Spain_CW.1.t: "Spanish Civil War"
 Spain_CW.1.d: "Ever since the victory of the Popular Front in the elections, a military conspiracy has been brewing to overthrow the government. Aiming to ‘reestablish order in the nation and recover the international prestige of Spain’, a group of generals is attempting to execute a ‘strike of force’ to put General Sanjurjo, currently exiled, in power. Since April, General Mola has been directing the conspirators under the codename ‘the director’. He has designed a coup which will, through extreme speed and violence, overthrow the government immediately. The execution of José Calvo Sotelo, leader of the opposition early the 13th of July has caused the Carlists and the CEDA to align themselves with the conspiracy, as well as several skeptic generals, including the ex-leader of high command, General Franco. This prompted Mola to choose the 18th of July as the date of the uprising. The morning of the 17th in Melilla, the local rebellious officers carry out a reunion with falangist leaders to plan for the following day. One of the Falangists informed the local leader of Unión Republicana, who reports to General Romerales, who in turn informed Casares Quiroga, member of the Popular Front. Romerales then sent a detachment to arrest the rebellious officers, but the leader of the detachment informed the Legion, who sent a patrol to stop the detachment and arrest general Romerales, who was then executed along with other local authorities. The State of War was declared, and the uprising began, after informing the rest of the Moroccan army that they had been discovered. In the last three days, the uprising has extended all around the country, and most of our army is now up in arms against us, occupying a large part of our territory. Although they have failed to take control of the capital and the larger cities, they are as we speak commencing the march in what they call the new ‘Reconquista’ towards our remaining cities and attempting to liberate their companions who are resisting heavy sieges all around the country, such as Oviedo or Toledo."

 SPR_1933_CEDA_Victory: "CEDA Victory"
 SPR_1933_CEDA_Victory_desc: "After the radical and disastrous policies of the murderous left, a new government has finally been formed! A strategic alliance between the centrist Radical Republican Party and the right-wing CEDA will finally put a good agenda forward!"

 SPR_Unite_Spanish_Conservatives: "Unite Spanish Conservatives"
 SPR_Unite_Spanish_Conservatives_desc: "Spanish conservatives are divided between different groups with specific policies. The CEDA has shown its ability to unite rural and suburban communities in a centralized manner. We should expand our political influence on these groups."

 SPR_Issue_of_Land_Reform: "Issue of Land Reform"
 SPR_Issue_of_Land_Reform_desc: "The old republican government put a very ambitious and radical plan to expropriate lands from rich estate owners, and place them into the hands of the inexperienced and dangerous landless peasants. Many conservatives and right wing politicians feel very threatened by these actions. We need to take a stance on the previous land reform and either repeal it or come to a sensible compromise."

 SPR_Form_Rural_Organizations: "Form Rural Organizations"
 SPR_Form_Rural_Organizations_desc: "Many rural peasants are lazy, arrogant, and landless folk that believe the lies of the left. These landless rabble have incited violence against landlords and other peasants. However, many spanish peasants, specially landed ones in the north, are very conservative and we can unite them against these leftists terrorists!"

 SPR_The_Church_and_the_Republic: "The Church and the Republic"
 SPR_The_Church_and_the_Republic_desc: "For many centuries, the Catholic church has been one of the most powerful institutions in Spain and remain an influential establishment. However, the new republic has separated the Church and the state, and worst of all, churches and priests are being hunted down and attacked by radical leftists. We need to take a stance on the situation and reassure Spanish citizens."

 SPR_The_Eight_Hour_Work_Day: "Eight Hour Work Day"
 SPR_The_Eight_Hour_Work_Day_desc: "Many trade unions and industrial institutions are calling for a massive reform to the current restrictions on work hours. An eight hour workday would mean a significant shift towards radical policies and could also decrease production. Many in the government have pressured us towards the decision but we must still issue the official policy."

 SPR_The_Popular_Front: "The Popular Front"
 SPR_The_Popular_Front_desc: "The Popular Front has formed and it is threatening the current Right-Wing government. The leftists, liberals, and republicans have come together to stand against our so called “fascism” we will have to make more moves to assure a victory in 36’."

 SPR_Embrace_Radical_Politicians: "Embrace Radical Politicians"
 SPR_Embrace_Radical_Politicians_desc: "Politicians like Gil Robles, that have openly made fascist announcements, can be important political figures for winning the 1936 election. If we can ally ourselves with many in the CEDA and stay in touch with ultra traditionalists, we could pull of a victory!"

 SPR_Cooperate_with_the_Army: "Cooperate with the Army"
 SPR_Cooperate_with_the_Army_desc: "We won the support of our people for the upcoming Civil War and now only the army remains. We need to bring them to our side. We should introduce them to our visions and convince them to fight for us. They will see that Spain can only be a major power under fascist leadership. Success here may bring the glory that the Spanish people have been dreaming about for ages."

 SPR_Popular_Front_Victory: "Popular Front Victory"
 SPR_Popular_Front_Victory_desc: "After a tense race to the top between the CEDA and the Popular Front, it seems that the left wing coalition has had the best of the results. Despite winning by a small margin of the population headcount, the deputies are largely in the hands Popular Front’s favor by a margin of 100. This will give the left ample space to pass and execute legislation, much to the dismay of the right."

 SPR_Reverse_CEDA_Legislation: "Reverse CEDA Legislation"
 SPR_Reverse_CEDA_Legislation_desc: "Now that we are in control, the “reforms” passed by the authoritarians will have to be rectified as we move forwards. Their policies have gone only to strike and silence the righteous workers of Spain those whom are trying to fight for their daily bread, for better working conditions, for a brighter future. All laws persecuted any citizen for their political belief shall be rescinded, all laws that have lined the pockets of profiteers shall be shattered and all laws that have regressed our society closer to those akin to medieval times shall be rectified."

 SPR_Appease_the_Catalans: "Appease the Catalans"
 SPR_Appease_the_Catalans_desc: "The Catalans have been instrumental to our victory in these elections. Their efforts go to fight against the ravenous right wing, heavily Castilian centric parties that aim to destroy the centuries old Catalonian culture and to replace it with their own twisted version of Castilian culture. As such we must show them our gratitude for their help and for the sake of the peaceful continuation of our union to grant them their requests of self-governance freedoms."

 SPR_The_Republican_Deal: "The Republican Deal"
 SPR_The_Republican_Deal_desc: "Today, we say no! Today, we refuse, and today, we deny! What is it we abhor, why...it is the ideals of radicalism! The same ideals that have condemned countless countries to a fate worse than death! Russia, Germany, Italy, all have suffered under the jackboot of radicalism, but not Spain. Oh, oh no, not today.\n\nWe will not become another despotic, tyrannical, monstrous regime, hellbent on destroying any pretext of liberty in the Western world. Even if it means that our country will suffer some growing pains, it will not be susceptible to the malignancy known as radicalism.\n\nSpain will not fall to it! Not today, not tomorrow, or ever!"

 SPR_An_Economic_Compromise: "An Economic Compromise"
 SPR_An_Economic_Compromise_desc: "In order to satiate the reformists, while also needing to counteract the radicals within our government, we have decided to one of the more unlikelier things-a compromise. You see, we must satiate the needs of reform within our country, yet at the same time, not succumbing to the ideas of radicalism. With that in mind we shall make some...concessions to the reformists.\n\nThese concessions shall be: an increased wage, a shorter work time, more benefits for workers, farmers, and craftsman alike, as well as a right to protest.\n\nWhile these will be seen as revolutionary for the Spanish people, there will be those that say ‘it’s not enough, we need more change’. Well, tell them that is is reality, and reality is separate from their fantasy world."

 SPR_Isolate_Radical_Leftists: "Isolate Radical Leftists"
 SPR_Isolate_Radical_Leftists_desc: "While we have been and always will be opposed to the violent, barbaric ideologies of radicalism in the right, there is an issue where there the same must be applied to the left. One must delve into what the radicals desire, and then and only then, can one realize what they truly want. An abolition of the Republic we fought hard to establish, the destruction of our culture, traditions, and lifestyles, seeing them as only reactionary. If we are to survive, there must be something done.\n\nNow of course, we cannot just kill them, that'd be too barbaric, and too deserving of them. Instead we must do something akin to a doctor-isolation. If we isolate the malignancy, then rest assured, the problem will simply die off on its own, and with that, our republic can be safeguarded against any other malignancies."

 SPR_CEDA_Reelected: "CEDA Reelected"
 SPR_CEDA_Reelected_desc: "Our leaders have been successful in bring us to greatness, they have brought us unimaginable riches and have made us happy. The people love their leaders for bringing prosperity and jobs to the country bringing us once again not only into the spotlight of the world but also a hub of trade and diplomacy."

 SPR_A_New_CEDA_Is_Elected: "A New CEDA Is Elected"
 SPR_A_New_CEDA_Is_Elected_desc: "Our current leaders have failed us, they have lied and stole from us and deserve to not be in power. And in a new wave we shall wash them out of the party and put a party more, in tune with the peoples liking's to bring our country one again back into greatness and the spotlight in international diplomacy."

 SPR_Support_Privatization: "Support Privatization"
 SPR_Support_Privatization_desc: "We need to support the burghers in Madrid and Barcelona that have suffered so much from the radical and dangerous policies of the Republican left. If we can support the developing industries and privatize new government assets, we may be able to increase productivity and improve our trust."

 SPR_Enforce_Labor_Regulations: "Enforce Labor Regulations"
 SPR_Enforce_Labor_Regulations_desc: "It is important to put the upstart trade unions and radical syndicates in their place! Spain’s productivity and economy has been sluggish for many years and we cannot afford to loosen standards for the trade unions. Crush their autonomy!"

 SPR_Hit_back_on_Barcelona: "Hit back on Barcelona"
 SPR_Hit_back_on_Barcelona_desc: "With our victory, Barcelona, a hotbed of socialist and separatist sentiments, has risen up in protest against the results of the supposedly "rigged" election. These ungrateful Communists and Anarchists have made their contempt for the will of the majority of the Spanish people in rejecting their foul ideal clear and we should teach them a lesson in return."

 SPR_Find_Extreme_Allies: "Find Extreme Allies"
 SPR_Find_Extreme_Allies_desc: "With CEDA in power we need to rally all Spanish patriots to our cause of defending God and the nation from the Red menace. The Falangists and the various monarchist and nationalist movements, though condemned by the left and the Republicans as fascists out to destroy our nation, share our goals of ridding the nation from the plague of socialism, and as such would make valuable allies to our cause."

 SPR_Draw_the_Front_Closer: "Draw the Front Closer"
 SPR_Draw_the_Front_Closer_desc: "The Popular Front is made of various disparate factions of Republicans, Social Democrats, Socialists, and Communists. It is fractured internally between many factions with some wanting to preserve the republic in it's current state and others seeking Communist revolution. These divisions will do much to hinder our efforts to stop the fascist threat within SPain and in enacting progressive policies. We must find a way to work out the difference between our various factions if we are to survive."

### Civil War
 SPR_No_Parasan: "No pasarán"
 SPR_No_Parasan_desc: "They thought our government was weak, that we would fall immediately. Our coalition will not falter, we will be victorious, let us crush their dreams, let us crush these Nationalists once and for all! To show them this, we will fortify Madrid, we will fortify the heartland! They will never conquer our capital, they shall never pass through the city!"

 SPR_Maintain_Solidarity: "Maintain Solidarity"
 SPR_Maintain_Solidarity_desc: "We must maintain solidarity in our Front. Our leadership is fragmented although the coalition is the only thing that keeps all of these different parties together. We have to please the communists, but the less-radical members of our 'alliance' shouldn't be forgotten. The growth in power of other parties should also be noticed. This Front is very fragile and just a simple mistake could mean the end of it."

 SPR_Decentralize: "Decentralize !"
 SPR_Decentralize_desc: "Power must not be in the hands of few, but in the hands of many. The unions, for example, have a very limited ability to decide the future of the country, although some say that they are crucial to the survival of our coalition. We have to listen to those voices, we will decentralize."

 SPR_Power_to_the_Unions: "Power to the Unions !"
 SPR_Power_to_the_Unions_desc: "Power to the unions, power to the unions, many chant. We are left with no choice. Not granting them power would bring our coalition to the brink of dissolution. Although we will lose some of our privileges, we will lose them for the greater good, for España. Power to the unions!"

 SPR_Failure_in_Barcelona: "Failure in Barcelona"
 SPR_Failure_in_Barcelona_desc: "We have failed! The traitorous anarchists have held Barcelona. This is the end. Our forces are depleted, our people have lost their faith in us and our Front is falling apart. We have lost."

 SPR_Surmount_other_Unions: "Surmount the other Unions"
 SPR_Surmount_other_Unions_desc: "We have to take away the power of some unions. With the anarchists successful we have become losing power,leading to the CNT-FAI being dominant in the country. We have lost."

 SPR_Crush_Anarchists: "Crush Anarchists"
 SPR_Crush_Anarchists_desc: "The Anarchist may have rebelled, but we have pushed them back and Barcelona is ours. These beasts shall get what they deserve, they will pay for what they have done, they will pay for weakening us, they will be crushed!"

 SPR_Communist_Control: "Communist Control"
 SPR_Communist_Control_desc: "The Communists are beginning to take over this country. These radicals have rose to power. Despite our efforts, they have become very popular, leading to the fall of our current government. What future awaits España is up to debate, but nothing good can come out of this civil war."

 SPR_Stick_to_Republic: "Stick to the Republic"
 SPR_Stick_to_Republic_desc: "We shall stick to the republic. It has lead us through good and bad, through hell and back. The experiment was a success. The Republic fights on, for España!"

 SPR_Crush_the_Communes: "Crush the Communes"
 SPR_Crush_the_Communes_desc: "We have to crush the communes. Their increase in power is worrying. We have to do anything to stop this growth in popularity. The leaders should be arrested and their communes dissolved. We must move fast and in secret or our leadership will be in danger. For freedom!"

 Deradicalize_Front: "De-radicalize the Front"
 Deradicalize_Front_desc: "Extremists have become prominent in our Front. This is unfortunate. If the number of radicals surpasses that of our own party members, we might lose power. We have to begin de-radicalization, or the communists or others will take over our Front."

 SPR_Liberal_Republic: "A Liberal Republic"
 SPR_Liberal_Republic_desc: "A liberal,democratic Republic, that is what we need. Everything else has failed us. We have to give power to the people, as they are the only ones still capable of managing this country successfully. We shall give them liberties and rights, leaving them to be free,to do something greater. For the spanish people!"

 SPR_A_Popular_War: "A Popular War"
 SPR_A_Popular_War_desc: "This is the war of the people. The war where the people decide. They decide who will rule them for the rest of the 20th century and perhaps the 21st century. This is a great struggle,which should not be ignored. We must fight, fight for our country, for Spain, for the Popular Front!"

 SPR_Regulate_Militias: "Regulate The Militias"
 SPR_Regulate_Militias_desc: "Not everyone is able to fight. Our militias have become a disorganized, diverse force. No more!We have to put it back together, we must conscript only the best!Death to the Nationalists!"

 SPR_Organized_Force: "Organized Forces"
 SPR_Organized_Force_desc: "We are making the final changes. The militias have evolved from a weak to a powerful, fear inducing force. Our grand offensives will begin, Franco and his group will be defeated!"

 SPR_Arm_The_Workers: "Arm The Workers !"
 SPR_Arm_The_Workers_desc: "We will arm the workers! We will show everyone the power of the working class and we will beat the Nationalists in one swift push. Everyone loyal to our Front shall rally together and fight the enemy!"

 SPR_Mobilized_Workplaces: "Mobilized Workplaces"
 SPR_Mobilized_Workplaces_desc: "Everyone must be ready for war. Any soldier can turn the tides of this war. We have to mobilize the workplaces, we have to be prepared, so when the Nationalists come, they will be destroyed, they will beg for our mercy, but they will not get any."

 SPR_Fight_Against_Fascism: "Fight Against Fascism"
 SPR_Fight_Against_Fascism_desc: "Our great fight against this horrible ideology has started. This disease has been spreading through Europe much like flu of 1918. We must take out these Nationalists before they get too powerful, we must not let this ideology grow in supporters!"

 SPR_Smash_The_Church: "Smash the Church"
 SPR_Smash_The_Church_desc: "We must smash the church. The influence it has in our country is immense. This leaves us only one option ; for our dreams to be fulfilled, the church must be restricted from any of our affairs. Although this may be unpopular with the more devoted part of the population it is a necessary step for a greater Spain."

 SPR_collapsing_society: "A Divided Nation"
 SPR_collapsing_society_desc: "We are now the irrefutable proof that a house divided cannot stand. With the political landscape in our nation continuously polarizing, hostility between fellow Spaniards continues to grow. The government faces ever-growing criticism in the wake of social and economic downturn, thus fermenting tensions and bringing stability to an all-time low. Should the division in our nation go unresolved, we face disastrous consequences, even surmounting to a civil war. The Second Republic has stood strong, but shan’t stand for much longer."
 SPR_upstart_army: "Disgruntled Army"
 SPR_upstart_army_desc: "Recent military reforms brought into fruition by Azaña’s steady hand have brought to light a deep-seeded inefficiency within the army and navy. Despite their decent effectiveness, they seem to have disrupted the usually-complacent armed forces, pushing through much-needed changes yet bringing forth disorder upon the chaos of the current political turmoil. A malcontent army wins no battles, thus we must proceed with caution if we are to defend the nation amidst growing tensions. The global stage calls for us, but we cannot answer just yet."

 SPR_the_agrarian_reform: "The Agrarian Reform"
 SPR_the_agrarian_reform_desc: "Numerous unpopular land and agricultural reforms have compounded the already-high tensions within the general populace. Despite the minor increases in productivity, the issue remains the same: to appease one political adversary, we must displease another. The conservative elements of the Second Republic have denounced these reforms, stating that they place an unnecessary burden upon the landowners and, by extension, those who work the lands. All of this aside, the increased production provided by these reforms shall prove useful."

Barcelona and Zaragoza are in chaos, as well as various other cities with lesser Anarchist influence. These many men seek to push their agenda through violent pressure to businesses and government offices, disrupting the workflow further than ever before. Should this dark trend continue, we may find ourselves facing a third opponent in the elections--and warfare--to come. Appeasement has lost its appeal."

 SPR_riveras_debt_desc: "A nation cannot spend money it does not have, yet this did not stop Primo de Rivera from investing massively in continental infrastructure projects--investments that have not been earned back. Such massive expenditure to such a degree has left the Second Republic in serious financial troubles. We have taken on the debts of our predecessors, which must go paid, lest we ruin our credibility among the banks of Europe. Funds are continuously being diverted from public spending to pay off our obligations, putting a halt on economic growth for the time being. It would seem as though we must be more careful with spending in the future."
