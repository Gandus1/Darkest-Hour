 SWE_En_Svensk_Tiger: "En Svensk Tiger"
 SWE_En_Svensk_Tiger_desc: "Nestled in the middle of Scandinavia, lies our beautiful country with its responsible and proud people, while we Swedes are fully prepared to defend the borders of our great nation, external forces have tried to and will always continue in their efforts to threaten our country from the inside. Something as simple as hushing to talk about the latest industrial equipment in front of a stranger can contribute to national security, luckily every Swede, a tiger in his own right knows when to “Tiga”."

 SWE_Folkhemmet: "Folkhemmet"
 SWE_Folkhemmet_desc: "The average Swede doesn't have time to concern himself with stupid arguments about the “class struggle”, or which economic system works best. For him the bottom line should be, that he’s happy, has a stable job along with the necessary modern amenities in housing, healthcare and education for his children. Which is exactly what we are doing, building a people’s home, the home being our country, a home that accommodates a family of millions, and the family members reciprocate, working in a communal fashion to care for each other and their land, a true “folkhem” indeed."
