 USA_Landon.1.t: "Protests from the Teachers' Union"
 USA_Landon.1.d: "The day's newspaper tucked under her arm, Mary pushed through the back door, and into the White House mailroom. A mountain of letters greeted her.\n\n”The education cuts, I take it?”\n\nThey came in early this morning, her boss told her- mail from what must have been every little red schoolhouse in the country, all addressed to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. With a quiet sigh of determination, the young woman scooped up two dozen letters and carried them to her desk. It'll be another late night, she thought.\n\nSliding her trusty letter opener across the front of an envelope, Mary extracted its contents with a practised flourish.\n\n”Mr President, The budget cuts you've proposed are nothing short of shameful. I've taught here in Boulder for almost 15 years now, even spending some of my pay, as little as it is, to buy chalk. Never have I been asked to do so much with so little. The roof leaks in the winter. I've taken to using old apple crates to replace broken chairs. These children deserve an education, even if that only means being able to write their own name. Things are bad enough as they are; some of the other teachers from the union are talking about a strike-”\n\nThe letter went on until the end of the page, where it concluded with a single name; Louise Harris.\n\nGently biting her lip, the clerk began to pen a response."
 USA_Landon.1.A: "Dear Ms. Harris..."

 USA_Landon.3.t: "Rebalancing New Deal Budget"
 USA_Landon.3.d: "”Alright, Frank, where are we at?”\n\n”I asked my staff to create some folders regarding the cost of the New Deal, its general budget, and future projections concerning national debt. I have to warn you, Mr.President, this entire report is 80 pages long, so I fear we don't have to go over every detail in this meeting. I suggest that we schedule another meeting for Thursday or Friday if you please,”\n\n”No, I need to grab this problem by the horns. The other Republicans are already breathing down my neck to throw out the New Deal in this instant. What is the summary of your report?”\n\n”Ok, I will keep it brief: The biggest factor in the entire New Deal budget and thus the largest part of our expenses is the welfare and pensions spending. Some of the conservative Republicans even accuse us of aggressively throwing money at the people to get them to go bother someone else,”\n\n”On the other hand, education spending is also tearing a big hole into the budget. The report also suggests that a lot of money is wasted on the New Deal's bureaucracy. You throw it in at the top, and it disappears towards the bottom,”\n\n”How popular are these points with the public?”\n\n”They are very popular. I think you know why,”\n\n”Dammit, we'll have to cut at least something, otherwise, we might as well declare bankruptcy now. Lemme see...”"
 USA_Landon.3.A: "We have to cut welfare and pensions. It is simply too much money."
 USA_Landon.3.B: "Reduce the education budget, most of the money doesn't go to where it is supposed to go anyways."

 USA_Landon.4.t: "Business Support Act"
 USA_Landon.4.d: "FROM: OFFICE OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE IN DES MOINES, IOWA\nTO: MR JOSEPH SMITH, SMITHS GOODS LTD, DES MOINES; IOWA\nSUBJECT: TAX REBATE FOR [This.GetYear]\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nWe want to inform you that due to a calculation error, namely the filing of\nyour taxes according to the standards set before the adoption of the Business Support Act.\nAfter adjustments for the new current tax rates, we show an over-taxation of $368.23.\n\nWe will mail a check for said amount to you before year's end and would\nstrongly advise you to review the contents of the Business Support Act\nto avoid mistakes like this in the future.\n\nFurthermore, if you have any more questions or complaints you can\nvisit us at our office at 210 Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa.\nWith best regards, "
 USA_Landon.4.A: "Franklin Harburg - Department Lead"

 USA_Landon.5.t: "Congress Debates New Tax Law"
 USA_Landon.5.d: "Today another part of President Landon's agenda will finally be debated and voted upon in Congress: Tax Breaks. With the New Deal, came a significant increase in taxes, especially for larger businesses. These tax increases have been widely criticized by the Republican Party, calling it an ”unfair burden” and ”damaging for the economy”. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party insists that the existing taxes are necessary to maintain an acceptable standard of living for Americans, arguing that it is only fair that large businesses are taxed accordingly to their success. \n\nAs a Republican, President Landon himself favors generous tax breaks, but to advance his agenda beyond that, he needs to maintain at least some goodwill within the Democratic Party. Some people have already called for less generous tax breaks as a compromise. However, this has been criticized by members of both parties. \n\nIn the end, after many hours of debate and argumentation, Congress has come to a decision, which will soon affect every American."
 USA_Landon.5.A: "Generous Tax Breaks Will Ensure a Strong Economy!"
 USA_Landon.5.B: "We Need to Calm the Democrats A Bit - Compromise!"

 USA_Landon.6.t: "Return to Fiscal Conservatism"
 USA_Landon.6.d: "Today President Alf Landon has officially announced to Congress that his administration will seek to discontinue the policies of the New Deal to return to fiscal conservatism. While Landon has run for the White House opposing the New Deal, it still has come as a shock to many that the President who campaigned on a compromise has decided to enact this radical step to roll back the New Deal.\n\nLandon's plans are still not finalized, but it is expected that the main points will be a further decrease in Taxes, the Privatization of Agencies founded during the New Deal as well as some Protectionist Tariffs on foreign goods.\n\nEven though the Republican party is pleased with its success in Congress, there have been harsh criticisms from enthusiastic supporters of the New Deal, from the Democratic Party to the lower strata of society. Landon has nonetheless promised that his reforms will lead to widespread wealth and prosperity for all Americans."
 USA_Landon.6.A: "A Compromise Option no More."

 USA_Landon.7.t: "Dire Straits of Civic Federation"
 USA_Landon.7.d: "The National Civic Federation was originally in 1900 to serve as an economic organization that sought to bring together chosen representatives from big business, organized labor, and consumer advocates to mediate disputes arising between industry and organized labor.\nHowever, the National Civic Federation has long been on the decline, with workers criticizing the Federation as ” a puppet tool of big business” while the employers have reduced their financial backing and support due to the Federations support for Unions and collective bargaining, seen as ”watered down communism”, leaving the Federation in dire straits.\n\nNonetheless, President Landon has recognized the need for an organization capable of mediating class disputes and has chosen the National Civic Federation as the only organization capable of this job. Additional funding by the state and a public campaign aimed at increasing membership numbers and participation in the organization will pave the way for an empowered mediation platform where both the workers and their employers can work out their differences in a constructive,non-destructive way."
 USA_Landon.7.A: "There Is No Place for Class Struggle in Our America"

 USA_Landon.8.t: "Congress Debates Child Labor"
 USA_Landon.8.d: "Now that President Landon has chosen the way the American economy will take for the future the Congress has decided to debate the highly controversial topic of child labor.\n\nChild labor has never been a stranger to American society with many children starting to work in Factories at a young age, to support their families, often doing dangerous work for low wages.\n\nWhile the amount of child labor has steadily decreased over the years, only faring up again during the Great Depression the Democratic Party has nonetheless spent considerable amounts of time campaigning for the complete outlawing of Child labor, with the Republican Party arguing that any illegalization would lead to undeclared work, the destruction of the livelihoods for many families and a significant loss of personnel in the factories.\n\nThis topic is an extremely sensitive one, with almost all outcomes set to anger a good amount of the American people, where the Workers and Upper Class fear for a loss of money and workers, while the Middle Class is positioned firmly against any sort of ”barbaric” child labor.\n\nIn Congress, the debate will also be a heated one with politicians of both sides doing their best to swing to either side.\n\nNevertheless, the votes have been counted with the result being..."
 USA_Landon.8.A: "...the Complete Outlawing of Child Labor in the United States!"

 USA_Landon.9.t: "Lane and Landon Meet"
 USA_Landon.9.d: "”Ah Mr. Lane, a pleasure! Please have seat. Would you care for a drink?” The President presented the Republican with his best smile, practised to perfection by years of campaigning and politics.\n”A coffee if you don´t mind, the journey has been quite tedious. With only a splash of milk.”\nLane returned his fake smile, convincing the average person but as a President, one tends to learn quickly which smile is sincere and which isn´t. ”Of course. Nancy, could you please bring Mr.Lane his coffee? Thank you.”\nAs the Secretary quickly exited the room, the President once again faced the rebellious Republican.\n”I´m quite sure, you already know why I brought you here.”\n”Yes.”\n”And you know what I want you to do.”\n”Yes. But I am afraid that you have met a brick wall, Mr. President. What you want me to do is nothing short of a complete and utter betrayal of my principles. I will never back your ludicrous agenda.”\n”I see. Why?”\n”Why? Because you will ruin the lives of millions of people throughout this entire country you goddamm-... Ahem...excuse me. I am in quite an irritable mood today. Nonetheless, the people will not stand for this and I won´t either. Hardline Fiscal Conservatism will doom this country and this Party even more.”\nThe President let out a deep sigh and started massaging his temples.\n”Dammit Lane, it´s not like I am about to hand over the entire country to Henry Ford. You will see that the people will profit from this. We will get a real economy flowing again! Money, jobs, trade! Everything! We just need to get the business rolling again!”\n”By kicking the poor in the gutter? For a bit of money and power? You hero.”\n”Lane, we simply need to show unity for this one vote. I´ll make it up to you I promise. You will need money for your campaigns, you will get money. You will get a position in the government. Everything. I just need one vote.”\n”My soul for the world. Let me think about it. But rest assured that I won´t forget your offer.”"
 USA_Landon.9.A: "“I am sure you won´t”"

 USA_Landon.10.t: "Meeting with Garner and Rayburn"
 USA_Landon.10.d: "President Landon has big plans for this country, but with some Republican senators blocking our agenda, it is necessary to look over the Trenches and try to get at least some Democrats on our side. To convince the Democrats, President Landon has decided to call John Nance Garner and Sam Rayburn, both opponents of the New Deal and the unofficial leaders of the Anti-New Deal Democrats.\n\nIn this meeting, the President hopes to persuade both Garner and Rayburn to win them and their cliques' support by both appealing to their personal beliefs and making concessions to the Democrats further down the line. This move to blatantly decide behind our Parties back will certainly cause some animosity with the Republicans and their voters, but we shall do whatever we can to get the ball rolling again."
 USA_Landon.10.A: "Policy over Party."

 ### Revisiting Smoot-Hawley
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.1.t: "Revisiting Smoot-Hawley"
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.1.d: "Formally called the United States Tariff Act of 1930, the law has eventually taken the name of its sponsors, Senator Reed Owen Smoot and Representative Willis Chatman Hawley. Enacted in June 1930, the law raised the already high import tariffs on foreign industrial and agricultural products with the purpose of protecting American farmers and industries from international competition. Despite President Hoover’s reluctance and over 1.000 economists urging him to veto it, the protectionist Act passed amidst the fear caused by the Great Depression.\n\nThe consequences were felt almost immediately. Trading partners of the USA, already gravely affected by the effects of the economic crisis and the reconstruction costs following the Great War, had their economies further damaged by the Act. In a retaliatory move, 25 countries increased their own tariffs. International commerce declined by over two-thirds between 1929 and 1934, in no small part due to the protectionist laws implemented as a consequence of the Smoot-Hawley Act. The US economy suffered drastically, consequently plunging the country even deeper into the economic crisis.\n\nDemocrat President Franklin Delano Roosevelt wasted no time in reversing the law’s effects, passing the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934, which allows the White House to directly negotiate tariff policy with other heads of state.\n\nWith the coming of Alf Landon at the White House, however, a return to the old policy is to be undertaken. Arguing that the negative effects of the tariffs came as a result of the Great Depression only, the President has once more put forward the Tariff Act, stating that the economical resurgence and stabilization of the last years will assure that Smoot-Hawley will have its intended effects, protecting the US economy whilst propelling it ever upward."
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.1.A: "We Must Protect American Companies."

 USA_Smoot_Hawley.2.t: "Henry Ford Speaks Out Against the Bill!"
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.2.d: "American industrialist, business magnate, and founder of the Ford Motor Company and chief developer of the assembly line technique of mass production, Henry Ford is a known opponent of the Smoot-Hawley Act, famously going to the White House to convince former President Herbert Hoover to veto it, calling it an ‘economic stupidity’\n\nAs US economical prosperity seems to once again be at risk, the business magnate has restarted his rhetoric, stating that the Republicans forgot it was them who plunged the country even deeper into the Depression with their protectionist policies, and the Act would serve to only do it once more. Using his influence among industrialists and politicians alike, Ford hopes to mount a sizable enough opposition to force either the President or the Senate to drop their ‘childish dreams’, for ‘only children think they can get what they want by not giving to others.’"
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.2.A: "What Does He Know?"

 USA_Smoot_Hawley.3.t: "House Liberals Oppose the Bill!"
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.3.d: "In an unsurprising move, the Progressives, Democrats, and even some Republicans from the House of Representatives have released a joint declaration, in which they decry the Tariff Act as foolish and counter-intuitive to national interests. It appears that former President Roosevelt’s shadow still looms over the political landscape, the supposed success of his economic policies turning many to his free-trade rhetoric. \n\nIt is too late to have any of them change their mind. All that we can do is make sure the ones who still have our backs remain steadfast in their decision to have the Bill pass."
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.3.A: "We Must Push This Through, With or Without Their Support."

 USA_Smoot_Hawley.4.t: "The Bill Moves to the Senate"
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.4.d: "The day has finally come. With a narrow success in the House of Representatives, the Smoot-Hawley Act will now have to pass through the Senate, a far more hostile environment to our interests. The Democrats and Progressives will do anything in their power to make sure the Bill remains only in the documents of the National Archives, and shall never again ‘hurt the Land of the Free’. \n\nDebates, shouting matches, and ‘donations’ are but a few tactics employed by them and us to make sure the Act either fails or succeeds. Whoever succeeds will set the tone for the remaining Presidential term, with an opposition victory assuring an unstable political landscape for the remainder of Alf Landon’s term. \n\nAll that can be done now is to wait."
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.4.A: "Let's Hope All Goes Well..."

 USA_Smoot_Hawley.5.t: "The Bill has Passed!"
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.5.d: "Excellent news! After a fierce confrontation between us and the Democratic-Progressive opposition to pass the Smoot-Hawley Act one more time, we have won! It was a narrow win, as it was back in the summer of 1930, with 44 to 42 votes for, but our citizens can rest assured, for their voice has been heard.\n\nWe have no time to waste. We must implement the new tariffs. Foreign agricultural and industrial products will have their tariffs raised again, to the anger and detriment of the international community, no doubt. But our duty lies with the American people first and foremost. Surely they would do the same if they were in our position."
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.5.A: "Huzzah!"

 USA_Smoot_Hawley.6.t: "The United States has Imposed Tariffs on Us!"
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.6.d: "It seems the Americans have decided to not learn from the past, and have followed their isolationist policy even in the economic field. With the recent presidential victory of Alf Landon, the Republican has decided to revisit the Smoot-Hawley Act, a 1930 law that raised import tariffs on foreign agricultural and industrial products. Happening during the Great Depression, the effects of the Act certainly did not help any economy, not even the US one. With a trade downturn of over two-thirds, the tariffs only helped to further strain the economies of the world.\n\nBack then, we, along with many other countries, retaliated against this protectionist policy by raising our own tariffs on American goods. This helped somewhat, but the scrapping of the law by former Democrat President Franklin Delano Roosevelt led to a return of mutually beneficial trade and helped the recovery of international commerce.\n\nWith the return of the Smoot-Hawley Act, we find ourselves once again negatively affected by American economic theory backwardness. We can answer in kind, of course. Tariffs can once more be put on US goods. While this is a situation from which no one would benefit, we can at least mitigate the effects of the law, and hope that perhaps they will see reason, as they once did.\n\nAnother option is to simply accept reality and adapt accordingly. The US is an important trading partner, and further limiting commerce between us would lead to a worsening of relations. Having to deal with increased tariffs is certainly damaging to our economy, but decreasing our access to their markets, and theirs to our own, is a less desirable outcome."
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.6.A: "We Have More Important Issues to Deal With."
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.6.B: "We Must Protect Our Companies, Too."

 USA_Smoot_Hawley.6.t: "[Root.GetName] Retaliates!"
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.6.d: "As a consequence expected by all but a few, (Country name) have decided to retaliate by raising their own tariffs on our goods. This wouldn’t be the first time they did that, as the first passing of the Smoot-Hawley Act led to the same outcome during the Great Depression. \n\nThis time, however, it will be different. No longer as weak as during that dark period, our economy is far more resilient and capable of adapting to the volatility of international commerce. We are capable of resisting such blows to our trade, or so we hope. [Root.GetName] might eventually decide their tantrum may not be worth it and accept the price of trading with the Land of the Free. Of course, they can also continue on their course, and suffer the consequences. It matters little to us, for we have accomplished what we set out to do: protect American business and products."
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.6.A: "This Seems Familiar Somehow..."

 ### US Special Events
 US_special.1.t: "Stab in The Back"
 US_special.1.d: "The leadership of Italy assured America that they were desirous of peace, but the Government of Italy has now chosen to preserve what it terms its 'Freedom of Action' and the hand that held the dagger has struck it into the back of its neighbor. Some indeed still hold to the now obvious delusion that we of the United States can safely permit the United States to remain a lone island in a world dominated by force. We might once more have to intervene in a European war."
 US_special.1.A: "Here we go again..."

 ### USA Event
 USA.3.t: "Tornado outbreaks in the Southeast"
 USA.3.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]\nJust a few days ago an onslaught of tornadoes hit hard in the Deep South, reaching even into some parts of Mississippi. Accounts of the event tell us of about 10 to 12 tornadoes which touched down. Most affected were the towns of Gainesville, Georgia and Tupelo, Mississippi. While the inhabitants have just crawled out of the shelters and some lucky survivors escaped their destroyed homes, the question now lies on how both the local governments and the federal government will respond. While damages are still being quantified, experts estimate the total loss to be between 7 million and 14 million dollars."
 USA.3.D1: "Divert all posible federal resources."
 USA.3.D2: "Send a modest help."
 USA.3.D3: "Send only leftovers."
 USA.3.D4: "WHAT?! Reinforce it immediately."
 USA.3.F1: "Send a special delegate to instruct direct orders."
 USA.3.F2: "Send some written orders to the local autorities."
 USA.3.F3: "Take those who are willing to leave to the front."
 USA.3.F4: "Send in the volunteers to repair it with haste!"
 USA.3.C1: "Send the jobless of other towns to repair."
 USA.3.C2: "Send the lowlife criminals to deal with it and watch over them."
 USA.3.C3: "Go somewhere else with your problems."
 USA.3.C4: "Divert some "volunteers" to it."

 USA.4.t: "Memorial Day Massacre"
 USA.4.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]\nFollowing the United States Steel Corporation signing a union contract, many other smaller steel companies have refused to join, leading to the Steel Workers Organizing Committee to call a strike in protest. On Memorial Day, tensions rose to a boiling point as hundreds of protestors gathered at the SWOC headquarters and began a march towards the Republic Steel mill, their path blocked by the Chicago Police, leading to a heated confrontation. Feeling threatened the police officers opened fire on the crowd, and in the resulting chaos, at least thirty protestors were hit by police bullets, killing ten, while some hundred others were beaten with clubs, at least thirty-seven suffering serious head injuries."
 USA.4.A: "The people were exercising their rights, violence was not the answer!"
 USA.4.B: "The police had justifiably suppressed the red riot."

 USA.5.t: "\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" Premieres"
 USA.5.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]\nThough animation had been used for featurettes and other short films before, for the first time this technology has been used in a feature length, full-color movie. Premiering at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Hollywood and set to show nationwide in the following months, Walt Disney's film, based on the classic fairytale, has been met with critical praise and sets a new precedent for the future of animation in the cinema. It is predicted to be a top earner at the box office following its initial premiere."
 USA.5.A: "Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, it's off to work we go!"

 USA.6.t: "Floods and Landslides in LA"
 USA.6.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]\nIn the span of just a few days, two separate Pacific storms nearly washed California away as they deposited over a year's worth of rain in less than a single week. Three major rivers, the Los Angeles, the San Gabriel and the Santa Ana, burst their banks and caused much flooding to the coastal plains and surrounding valleys, inflicting over $78 million in damages, and taking over one hundred lives in the devastation. \n\nIn order to prevent future events like this from occurring, the Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies have proposed a new system of channels, control dams and basins to contain and prevent any future floodwater."
 USA.6.A: "Approve the proposal."
 USA.6.B: "It would be too expensive."

 USA.7.t: "Boulder Dam Begins Operation"
 USA.7.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]\nJust three years after construction had started, the world's largest dam begins to generate power in the Southwest. Though only a single turbine runs at the moment, over the next few years more and more will come online with an eventual power output of over a billion kilowatt hours per year, providing electricity for California and the rest of the Southwest for many decades."
 USA.7.A: "Impressive"

 USA.8.t: "Panic on the West Coast"
 USA.8.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]\nThere's panic in the West...\nAfter the brutal attack on Pearl Harbor, everyone believes that the West Coast will be attacked next, especially San Francisco and Los Angeles. They are some of our most important cities, we cannot afford to lose them. Our commanders are quickly creating defensive plans in case of a naval invasion. We must set up AA towers, fortify the beaches and prepare for the worst. The Japanese, these criminals, will be stopped, democracy will prevail and these monsters will be dealt with. We will chase them all the way to their capital, we will avenge the millions of human beings that died so their countries could survive."
 USA.8.A: "For Freedom"

 USA.9.t: "National Labor Relations Act"
 USA.9.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]\nFollowing years of liberal legislation, the New Deal has turned its proverbial eyes to the question of trade unions. Legalized in Britain over half a century ago, unions set to equalize the playing field of labor and management, negating the imbalance of bargaining power by adhering to the collective. If a single man cannot stand his ground against the greed of management, he might find solace in his fellow workers striving towards the same goals: fair pay, fair hours, fair benefits.\nOn this day, amidst another push of the New Deal, Franklin D. Roosevelt has signed the National Labor Relations Act into law, enforcing the will of the worker whilst maintaining the market economy America was built upon. Critics may say this is a step towards the ways of communism, but dissidents of the New Deal may be ignored with all good faith. This bill of law marks one step closer to our goal."
 USA.9.A: "Workers everywhere rejoice!"

 USA.10.t: "Amelia Eartharts wants to join the USAAC"
 USA.10.d: "“Next!”\n\nFor three months now, the war has raged on in Spain. The government, in its policy of neutrality, knows one thing: war will come to America one day. So, in preparation of any coming conflict, new recruits have been raised across the nation. But what no one had envisaged was the idea that war can attract even personalities, and today, a pioneer of aviation, Amelia Earhart herself, is in a recruiting office!\n\nHaving someone so famous in our ranks can have many advantages: Amelia knows how to fly; she has a good knowledge of the world, like the Atlantic, California, and Pacific Ocean; and of course, she is popular, maybe at the same point of Charles Lindbergh a few years ago. Who know how far can a celebrity help the cause of the army? Can she incite the population to join us? Even after ten years of existence, the U.S.A.A.C is not gigantic like the U.S Army or the U.S. Navy, and we really need everyone who is willing to fight on our side.\n\nOn the other side, Mrs. Earhart is just a citizen, not a soldier. She knows how to pilot planes, but how can we be sure she has the will to go and fight? How many time will it take to teach her about all the military terms? Lastly, there are even some in the army who will say that a woman cannot be sent into battle, saying that the army is not a playground, and that famous people have no business being here.\n\nThe final choice, of course, is up to the recruiting officer:\n\n“Mrs. Earhart, your request to join the U.S.A.A.C is ...”"
 USA.10.A: "“...Approved! Welcome to the USAAC! Young blood for a new fight!”"
 USA.10.B: "“... Denied! The Army is for fighters, not celebrities!”"

 ### FDR Assassination Attempt
 USA_FDR_Assassination.1.t: "Party in Miami"
 USA_FDR_Assassination.1.d: "”Now, don't you worry.” The president-elect told a handful of reporters, a smile crossing his face. ”I'll be coming back. You'll all have to put up with me for at least another four years!” The assembled onlookers laughed.\n\nVincent Astor's yacht, the Nourmahal, awaited her passenger in the background, Miami's winter sun reflecting off her white hull. In a few minutes, Roosevelt would board, along with a small group of personal friends and political allies.\n\nTheir opulence disgusted him.\n\nThe anarchist surged toward the front of the crowd, his hidden hand tracing the machined steel contours of the eight-dollar revolver.\n\nAs the crowd began to disperse, Roosevelt turned to Chicago Mayor Tony Cermak, ready to depart.\n\n”Too many people are starving!”, Five deafening gunshots rang out, transforming the small-talking crowd into a screaming mob. Four bullets flew wildly into the horde, striking three fleeing Miamians and a security guard. The last shot, however, as if aware of the gunman's intent, flew straight for the president-elect's car-"

 USA_FDR_Assassination.2.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]\nToday America narrowly avoid a political catastrophe as President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt nearly lost his life in an assassination attempt, an event which likely would have disrupted America's political scene greatly and influenced life in the USA for decades to come. But while Roosevelt got away unharmed, five other people were gravely wounded, with Anton Cermak, Mayor of Chicago, unlikely to survive his injuries. \n\nThe would-be assassin has been identified as Giuseppe Zangara, an Italian immigrant who had hoped to kill Roosevelt, for reasons still unknown, with a revolver he had bought a few days earlier. His plan failed, however when several bystanders grabbed his arm, after the first shot leaving Zangra to wildly discard four shots into the crowd, each injuring a bystander, before being wrestled to ground. \n\nWhile the assassination-attempt is a traumatizing event for many politicians and attendees, many others are glad that Roosevelt was not harmed and will assume his office in a few months."

Roosevelt, the president-elect of the United States of America has been murdered by an assassin during a speech in Miami, Florida being the fourth president in history to have his life cut short by assassination. \n\nThe Assassin has been identified as Giuseppe Zangara, an Italian immigrant who shot Roosevelt in the chest with a revolver he had brought a few days before, while Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, as well as several bystanders, were seriously wounded by stray bullets. \n\nThe motive of the assassin is currently unclear with Zangara still being in interrogation, while the rest of nation scrambles to find a suitable replacement with Roosevelt's running mate John Nance Garner becoming the new president-elect.

 ### US 1933 Elections Events
 USA_Elections_1932.1.t: "Franklin Roosevelt Inaugurated 32nd President"
 USA_Elections_1932.1.d: "[USA.GetNewsIcon]Today the inauguration of the Democratic candidate for the Presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was held. With his hand over the 250-year old Dutch Bible, Roosevelt took the presidential oath to Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes on the Senate chamber of the United States Capitol in Washington D.C., thus becoming the 32nd President of the United States. He then delivered a memorable twenty minute-long inaugural address, where he addressed the many economic problems affecting the American nation. Roosevelt emphasized the necessity of strong and vigorous leadership, asking for the support of the people in these dark times. He also accused the bankers and the financial sector of allowing the economic crisis to happen for their own incompetence and their unscrupulous greed, calling for regulations on the banking and business sectors. Referring to the high unemployment rate, Roosevelt lamented the thousands of families losing their savings and stated the need for quick and decisive action to ”put people back to work.” He briefly touched the issue of foreign policy, compromising to continue good relations with other countries, and ended his speech by requesting the Congress grant full executive powers to deal with the economic emergency.\n\nThe speech was very positively received by the American public, with a woman calling the President someone ”worthy of every ounce of support a true American has.” Many Americans feel that his rhetoric is pretty convincing and dynamic, making a big contrast with the past residents of the White House. It looks Roosevelt represents the change that America so desperately needs right now. Only time will tell if he'll succeed in his endeavors."

 USA_Elections_1932.2.d: "A significant event in Wisconsin politics occurred today with the formation of a new political force: the Wisconsin Progressive Party. Philip La Follette and his brother, Robert M. La Follette Jr., announced that the WPP would run in the state for the midterm elections this year, with the WPP becoming an alliance between Progressive Republicans in Wisconsin and the more radical labor groups. Other Republicans and even some Democrats have expressed concern about this, fearing that it will hurt their chances in the state, with some political analysts even speculating that they might band together to stop them, which seems unlikely.\n\nBoth of the La Follette brothers hope to use their new party as a platform to help them re-elect to their respective positions in government: Phillip as Governor of Wisconsin and Robert as Senator. Whether or not this occurs is up to voters, but the formation of a new political party certainly adds to the excitement of what promises to be an interesting midterm election season."

It is the first time since the Civil War that an incumbent President's party has gained seats in a midterm election, which the Democrats will celebrate because it allows them to continue with their domestic agenda.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, the Republicans fared poorly, losing seats to Democrats and even Progressives. It remains to be seen how they will recover from this, but they will need to come up with a plan quickly if they are to win the next election."

The Democrats will be pleased because they will continue to govern with a reasonable majority, though they will be disappointed that they did not achieve the gains they expected due to their domestic policies. There may even be reason to reconsider how it is implemented in the future.\n\nRepublicans are pleased that they suffered no overall losses, but they are said to be disappointed that they were unable to make a significant dent in the Democratic hold on Congress.

Nearly a year of work had gone on in and around that desk, all in an attempt to follow through on their promise to cure the ailments that the nation was experiencing. On one side of the desk was the Secretary of the Treasury, William H. Woodin, the quintessential image of an effective bureaucrat and businessman. When he first took office with the man across from him, the President, he was full of energy, optimism, and life, but over the course of the year, he had become weary, and tired of it all.\n ”Mr. President I am sad to be here today to give you this news but I am afraid I no longer feel I am fit to execute my duties as your Secretary of the Treasury.”\n ”I see, and what makes you believe this?" The President had expected something like this. He too had seen Woodin's fading enthusiasm.\n ”I’m not a young man any more sir, and my doctors have been telling me to slow down. I can feel it in my bones that they’re right.” Silence filled the room.\n ”You'll be leaving some big shoes to fill." The President pulled out a lighter and lit a fresh cigarette. ”Any ideas on who'll fill them?”\n ”There's a multitude of men in your camp and in my department I could recommend, but the best that comes to mind at present is Henry Morgenthau Jr. You're familiar with him and his work already from his time in Albany with you, and he's done a good job on the Federal Farm Board. He's behind you on the New Deal and he’s committed to keeping the operation as clean as possible.”\n ”A good choice. I’ll have to sleep on it of course, but I think he's the man I'll put in,” the President said, puffing smoke clouds towards the view of the Capitol.\n ”Well then, if there's nothing else, I do have a few more duties to complete before I leave.”"

 ### US 1936 Elections Events
 USA_Elections_1936.1.t: "The 1936 Republican National Convention"
 USA_Elections_1936.1.d: "With Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s victory in the 1932 election and the end of the Republican Party’s sixteen-year hold on the White House, the situation the country finds itself in seems to have improved. Roosevelt has unified the Democratic Party behind him, and the Republican Party must do the same if they are to occupy the Oval Office once more. In this year's GOP National Convention, there were initially three likely candidates, but as one, namely Senator William Borah is fading, the race is now between two men.\n\nThe first of these two men, Governor Alf Landon of Kansas, is a wealthy businessman and centrist. He is not only the most likely to win the nomination but also may have the greatest chance at defeating Roosevelt in the election, as he is not advocating for the abandonment of the New Deal programs that are providing relief to the economy. The second man is someone the people of America know well, the now-former president, Herbert Hoover. His hopes for nomination are thin, but with his significant political connections, it isn’t impossible for him to leech support off smaller candidates and surpass Landon.\n\nWhoever the Republican nominee is will be responsible with ensuring the party’s dominance in the future, but if they fail, Roosevelt and the Democratic Party will surely capitalise on that error and cement their position in American politics for years to come."

Whatever failures Hoover achieved through his reliance on the Invisible Hand began to get rectified; the mistakes he made were nothing in comparison to the success the New Deal has brought to the poverty stricken landscape. No challenger could even dare battle the President for the nomination.\n\nAnd Franklin Delano Roosevelt vows to go even further. In his acceptance speech, Roosevelt spoke to the everyday worker, those in the crowd the great Depression hurt the most. He spoke to their hearts, guaranteeing them he would fight for them. Not the corporations and banks that lowered the workers’ heads and diminished their pride, but the workers themselves, who will soon be able to stand upright and live in and for a country that cherishes them.\n\nBut the inner thoughts of the nominee held something different. Roosevelt knew he needed to change his approach; he knew the New Deal was not all it was cracked up to be. But Mr. Roosevelt would have the time to think it over. He had no need of campaigning; the Republican candidate could never surpass the love the people felt for him."

As the night progresses, the gap between the two candidates grows wider and wider, favoring Roosevelt even more.\n\nAfter a long night of counting ballots, the results are in, and Franklin Roosevelt is re-elected with a comfortable majority, having received most of the votes of the electoral colleges, as well as an overwhelming majority of citizens' votes.\n\nClearly, Hoover's triumphant return to politics was not going to happen this year, and some wondered if his defeat would signal the end of his career."

Despite the rain and mild cold, hundreds have taken to the streets of Washington to make their way to the east portico of the Capitol. Franklin Delano Roosevelt will be inaugurated for his second and probably last term as President of the United States. Vice President Garner will also be sworn in for his second term. The Chief Justice is presiding over the ceremonies.\n\nThis event will be the first test of the twentieth amendment, or the XX Provision. While it created rules on congressional term limits and potential electoral college deadlocks, chiefly, the Amendment has reduced the "lame-duck" period until the next Administration arrives. As such, January will be the new month for the transition of power, rather than March. Future presidents will have to have a good stock of coats to bear the potential icy Washington wind. But most see the change as good, making the transfer of power more efficient and swift.\n\nIt has been a tumultuous and eventful first term for FDR, but having easily won reelection back in November, the President is preparing another round of New Deal proposals, some more groundbreaking than his first term. And while the weather is tough on this bleary day in January, the sun is seemingly shining upon Roosevelt's fortunes for the next four years."

 USA_Elections_1936.6.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Come storm or shine, the steps of the U.S. Capital has graced many presidents on their inauguration days. And now, so too do they guide Governor Alf Landon of Kansas. Landon took the Oath of Office just after noon today, becoming the 33rd President of the United States, in the pouring rain.\n\nDespite many pollsters predicting a win for FDR, most notably down to his popular New Deal, the race had been much closer, and Alf Landon had surprised many by coming out on top. He turned out to be an effective campaigner and ran as a more centrist member of the GOP, trying to win back those who had voted Democrat, 4 years prior. Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania and Ohio, had results that were on a knife-edge and only just tilted towards Alf in the last moments, winning the popular vote by just over a million.\n\nLandon is expected to take a more moderate stance than the mainstream Republican Party. While some New Deal repeals are likely to come from the White House, the President seems poised to find a middle ground between the program and American business interests. Playing on pure domestic politics, his foreign policies remain to be seen. \n\nNevertheless, hopefully, the American recovery will continue. With a different man at the top."

Two camps have formed, each with their own ideas and opinions about what the WPP's next steps should be.\n\nThe first side contends that the WPP should be expanded to champion progressive ideas across the country rather than just in Wisconsin. This would be a massive political undertaking, but if they can replicate their success elsewhere, they may be able to compete with the Democrats and Republicans someday.\n\nThe other side claims that a merger with the Farmer-Labor Party would be much better for progressive issues. Supporters argue that forming a single stronger and more united progressive party would be preferable to having multiple parties that could be weaker and less likely to win. However, the two parties disagree on a few issues, so some compromises may be required.\n\nWhatever the party decides will undoubtedly have consequences not only for the state of Wisconsin, but potentially for the entire country, and both Democrats and Republicans will be watching what happens with bated breath."

Their plans appear to have collided now, as both parties have declared that they will form a "unified front," working together to retake the state senate from the WPP.\n\nWhile Republicans and Democrats have occasionally worked together on policy, forming an electoral alliance against a party much smaller than them has surprised some, as it is often a state heavily contested by the two parties. Others are unsurprised by the announcement, given that the WPP's popularity has been a thorn in the sides of the two major parties for nearly four years."

It is unknown what they will do together, but it is highly likely that they will caucus with each other on certain votes, specifically in the Wisconsin State Senate and State Assembly.\n\nHow the major two parties will react is yet to be seen, as both the Democrats and the Republicans have been watching the developments closely.

Despite the presence of several front-runners, including Robert Taft and Thomas Dewey, polls show Willkie with 44% of Republican support, far ahead of Dewey, who is in second place with 29%. Willkie has chosen Senate Minority Leader Charles McNary as his vice-presidential nominee, despite the fact that he was leading a "Stop Willkie" campaign. It remains to be seen whether the two will get along.\n\nWillkie is scheduled to deliver an acceptance speech, which will be televised locally.

Bricker. With 7,000 invited guests watching on, Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone administered the oath to Dewey, while Bricker took his oath from the now former vice president Henry A. Wallace. After this, Dewey proceeded to give a long speech, thanking those who supported him, as well as those in the public who voted for him. The President has promised to lead the USA through whatever tests come before it and fix what he called “mistakes made by Presidents who thought they were doing good”, signalling his opposition to the New Deal which he had called “Communist” in the past. Dewey had also wanted some sort of celebrations to take place as he did not want his achievement of defeating Roosevelt to go unnoticed, and so a small, watered-down parade took place later in the day, with the President hosting a gathering inside the White House afterwards.\n\nMany eyes of the world have also keenly watched this, as they wonder what to expect from the new President who has different ideas about how to run the nation. However, with conflict still raging on abroad, Dewey may find that he must put whatever domestic plans he has on hold until a way of keeping the peace in the world can be found."

 USA_Elections_1944.5.d: "Today, on a cold January day, President Roosevelt has been inaugurated for a record fourth term, the first time in the history of our great nation. While the ceremony was scaled down due to ongoing austerity measures because of the war, with the event taking place at the White House instead of the Capitol, it did not diminish the joyous occasion for the President and his new vice president, Harry S. Truman. With 7,000 invited guests watching on, Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone administered the oath to Roosevelt, while Truman took his oath from the now former vice president Henry A. Wallace. After this, Roosevelt proceeded to give a short speech, thanking those who supported him, as well as those in the public who voted for him. The President has promised to lead the USA through whatever tests come before it and continue to build a better and brighter country for all. Once the formalities were complete, Roosevelt hosted a gathering inside the White House, with the traditional parade and other events cancelled for the big day.\n\nMany eyes of the world have also keenly watched this, as they wonder what is yet to come from the President now entering his fourth term. However, with Roosevelt having been in declining health since 1940, there is speculation about how much more he must give, and whether his new vice president could find himself in the top job soon."

 USA_Fireside.1.t: "The Arsenal of Democracy"
 USA_Fireside.1.d: "Democracy is under threat all over the world. With the fascist threat engulfing much of Europe and Japan striking deep into Asia, the situation for the cause of liberty for all could not be worse. Yet, in the United States, we have avoided all of the chaos, and we are in a relatively comfortable position, with the economy growing day by day. However, this does not mean that we should sit back and watch the world burn around us; as a fellow democracy to the UK, France, and other European nations, we must do our part to ensure that they can stand up to Hitler and his cronies.\n\nWhile full-fledged intervention is not in our best interests, there are other ways we can assist democratic nations around the world. We will be able to ramp up production of military equipment that can be sent all over the world by utilizing our ever-growing industry. Guns, tanks, bombers, fighter planes, and artillery pieces will almost certainly be gratefully received by those who need them the most. Our presence will be felt from the battlefields of China to the deserts of North Africa, even if we are not directly present.\n\nPresident Roosevelt has also addressed the nation on the arsenal of democracy, saying that "if Great Britain goes down, the Axis powers will control the continents of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australasia, and the high seas - and they will be able to bring enormous military and naval resources against this hemisphere," a stark warning for our nation that has been isolated for so long. At the end of his radio address, Roosevelt reassured the public, "I believe that the Axis powers will not win this war," which we all hope he is correct."

 USA_FDR_New_Deal.1.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]\nPresident Roosevelt hasn't been wasting time and only a couple of days after taking the oath, he issued Proclamation 2039 that stated the effective suspension of all banking transactions. \n\nThe proclamation states that no withdrawal, deposit, transfer and other banking operation of any kind of currency (including gold and silver) from any banking institution is going to be made in a week. \n\nWhile people remain concerned about their money, there is little panic and everyone is trying to deal with this situation the best they can. The President is taking radical and drastic measures to restore confidence in the banking system and it seems that this is only the beginning for a general overhaul of the American economic system."

 USA_FDR_New_Deal.2.d: "So it finally can proceed. In one of the most awaited moments since the inauguration, President Franklin D. Roosevelt has introduced the nation to the members of his administration, a group of talented men who will change the United States for the better.\n\nSecretary of State Cordell Hull will manage America's stance on the international stage. An internationalist, Hull will lead America's efforts to step out and finally involve itself in world affairs as an advocate for liberty and democracy. In a departure from US interventionism in Latin America, he hopes to make America a 'good neighbor' to Mexico and the South American countries.\n\nOn the left sits William Woodin, the Secretary of the Treasury. Woodin will be crucial in implementing New Deal policy, removing the dollar from the gold standard to increase American economic independence and promote GDP growth.\n\nThe new Secretary of the Interior, Harold L. Ickes, will support Woodin's efforts- a man who will probably be the most responsible for achieving the New Deal's promises across America. Of particular consequence is the Public Works Administration- an institution that will come to aid thousands, if not millions, of Americans in search of a job and good pay.\n\nOther notable appointees include Homer Stille Cummings as Attorney General, serving as the President's legal advisor and lawyer for the Federal Government, and James Farley as the Postmaster-General, head of the United States Postal Service."

 USA_FDR_New_Deal.3.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Today, in a joint session of Congress, the Emergency Banking Act has been passed and signed by us, which is a great success for our administration.\n\nIt is no surprise that the banks were hit hard during the initial days of the Great Depression, and since then, confidence and stability have never returned in large amounts. Today that changes, and this act should help us to slowly begin to move forward out of the economic crisis. A four-day bank holiday was declared a few days ago, which shut all banks until congress could act to solve the problem. This has also allowed us to inspect the banks to see which ones could be saved and which ones, unfortunately, had to be closed. We are thankful to both the House and the Senate for passing this Act swiftly, and it seems they saw the urgency for this to be introduced as well.\n\nIt has also been decided that it will be a good idea to explain to the people of America what is contained within this Act, and a “fireside chat” has been arranged to do this in a comforting and welcoming environment for those watching and listening from home. If it is well received, we could always do more of these fireside chats to truly connect with the nation.\n\nThis is only meant to be a short-term solution to the initial problem posed, and hopefully, soon we will be able to introduce new legislation to reinforce this. But for now, the Emergency Banking Act will bring some stability to people’s lives, and something we hope to do more of with our plans to save the American economy."

While the nation is certainly not the first Great Power to abandon the Standard, it is certainly one of the most impactful to do so. Practically every civilized society on Earth felt the pain of the Black Tuesday stock market crash of 1929, showing just how easy Lady Liberty’s woes are to spread.\n\nWith American Gold now set to return to the US Federal Reserve, more Dollars can now be printed and unleashed into the global market.

 USA_FDR_New_Deal.5.d: "In the midst of the Depression, tensions run high between corporations, the government, and those working under such machinations of entrepreneurship. Large businesses shouldered the brunt of the blame for the Depression’s initial effects, failing to provide for their employees and thus causing millions of young men and women to go unemployed. Indeed, the nation’s economics are in a constant state of turmoil, only compounded by class tensions. Such an instance of this has been seen constantly over the past two years. Certain influential businessmen have expressed outrage over the current political state of affairs, stating that the New Deal unjustly targets large businesses with underhanded means such as anti-trust laws or special progressive taxes. Although angered, it is unlikely they will be able to manage much except disrupting the economic stability further than previously thought possible."

 USA_FDR_New_Deal.6.d: "A combination of devastating hurricanes, unsustainable economic practice, and the Great Depression has left the people of Puerto Rico in constant poverty and as the poorest piece of land in America. Acquired just over 30 years ago, Puerto Rico has never been a particularly prosperous territory. However, with its rather large population, we cannot simply ignore the tumultuous situation. Even before the disastrous ’20s, the island territory has faced nearly unlivable conditions, with their primary exports being controlled by oligopolies and tycoons unwilling to pay wages to the Puerto Ricans working the plantations. This is compounded by the fact that the sugar industry was hit particularly hard by the Great Depression, with fewer and fewer people having disposable income to purchase sugar products. All in all, the situation for Puerto Rico is dire, and we must establish an Alphabet Agency to deal with it. The Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration will divert government resources into the rebuilding of the island to ensure long-term economic stability and conditions suitable for Americans."

The same veterans who were protesting in the streets of Washington D.C. in 1932 because they could not claim what they were rightfully owed, can now begin to withdraw money that will surely help them in these challenging times.\n\nAs with many millions across the country, the veterans found themselves in the dark pit of unemployment, and without the ability to redeem cash from their service certificates until 1948, anger culminated in the protests seen in 1932, which ended with the army dissolving the demonstration. The Great Depression still bears down hard on our nation, so the threat of this happening again was high, which has led Congress to decide to act decisively. \n\nThe passing of the Adjusted Compensation Payment Act is not surprising, as we hold both chambers of Congress, leading to a large majority in favour of this. Payments will now begin to roll out across the nation, which could total up to $2 billion.\n\nAs for the veterans? They seem to be most pleased. They have fought and won the Great War, and now they seem to have won a “war” with the Federal Government over their bonuses. This must be a lesson that veterans of any conflict we fight in must be treated fairly by all."

Haiti, Cuba, Panama, Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua and even the Dominican Republic, have all seen some sort of intervention by the States, some of them several times. They have sought to manipulate our nations for their own political, diplomatic and economic gains. It is safe to say, trust in any American efforts in regard to us, are nonexistent.\n\nHowever, Franklin Roosevelt, the newly elected President of the United States, has called for a policy of realignment in his foreign policy. Calling it the ‘Good Neighbor’ policy, the President is proposing a withdrawal of the current military mission to Haiti and normalizing relations with Mexico, Cuba and the rest of the Latin nations. He also proposed new commerce and exchange deals as a way to bolster the novel strategy.\n\nWhile the details of the negotiations are yet to be hashed together, we know one thing. It will take more than just lucrative economic opportunities and a reset of relations to return our trust in Uncle Sam. We have been betrayed before and it could just as easily happen again. A concerted and serious effort will be required, by this new administration, to return the United States to good standing anywhere south of the Rio Grande."

 USA_FDR_New_Deal.9.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Today, in Montevideo in Uruguay, many countries from Central and South America, as well as the USA, have met during the Seventh International Conference of American States to sign the Montevideo Convention. The treaty underlines the importance that all signatories were recognised as equal sovereign states, and that members would not interfere with the foreign or domestic policies of another state.\n\nThis is a great achievement for US foreign affairs and comes under the greater scope of the Good Neighbour policy set out by President Roosevelt. It was also a historical day as the first female representative of the US was present at the signing of the treaty.\n\nIn total, 19 nations signed the convention, while 3 others accepting it with minor reservations, one of these countries being the United States, with Bolivia being the only country that did not sign. \n\nSome outside observers wonder if this will help the USA’s doctrine of Neutrality, as non-intervention was agreed within the treaty, which would help secure the US’s place within the New World."

Countries come and go, but the American Experiment has seen through strife, turmoil and even Civil War. While our fortune has been great and the nation has endured, unfortunately, our destiny has manifested in ways that the founders could call tyrannical too. Previous administrations have led several military interventions into our Latin American neighbors, in at least 8 different nations. Some of those, several times. Expectedly, trust in American values in our backyard is at an all-time low.\n\nHowever, with FDR now the Commander-in-Chief, the new administration is proposing a full reset on southern relations. Calling it the ‘Good Neighbor’ policy, the President is prepared to withdraw the remaining military mission to Haiti and the normalization of relations with Mexico and Cuba.Stating in his inaugural address, Roosevelt proclaimed ”I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor, the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others.” This has also been stated by Secretary of State Hull, saying ”No country has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another.”\n\nThis policy of non-intervention includes lucrative trade deals for Central American nations, hoping to add a level of trust to the new relationships. However, decades of interventions and bullying cannot be fixed with trades and a speech. It will be a real test of this administration’s diplomacy to restore America’s standing in these nations."

Order 6102 now forbids "the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States," effectively taking the country off the Standard of Gold. It is a monumental order, but one in lockstep with Roosevelt’s First 100 Days plan, carrying with it the hope to pull this country out of the steepest depression in our history.\n\nConsumers have been hoarding gold since the stock market began to collapse, a nature of these hard times. While most can’t be blamed for keeping their money close to the chest, it has only worsened economic spending and has devalued prices. By trading in their gold for a currency amount, the order will give more liquidity to spenders. It also will remove a constraint on the Federal Reserve, with demand notes requiring a 40% gold backing, raising their credit-issuing ceiling and allowing more currency to be printed.\n\nCitizens have until May 1st to bring in their gold deposits, where they will receive an exchange for banknotes at $20.67 per troy ounce."

 USA_FDR_1936.1.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]An amendment to the historic Social Security Act of 1935 was added today. Building on the historic law, changes have been made to increase the number of people assisted by benefit payments. The revision now allows retired workers' spouses and children to receive payments, as well as the family to receive payments in the event of an unexpected death if the worker is covered by the Social Security Act. Because of its scale, some have referred to this as "the second Social Security Act," with the act shifting from worker-based to more family-oriented.\n\nThe amendment also brought about some smaller, but more noticeable changes, such as an increase in the amount paid by social security and a move of the start of monthly payments to 1940. While other changes may be made in the future, none will be as significant as the one made today."

 USA_FDR_1936.2.t: "Cash and Carry Provisions"
 USA_FDR_1936.2.d: "The Neutrality Act of 1935 provided a solid foundation for our isolationist foreign policy, and it was widely supported by the public, who did not want to become involved in wars in which we had no place. An updated version of the act has now been accepted, with one feature that has piqued the interest of many: the implementation of cash and carry provisions.\n\nThe first Neutrality Act prohibited the sale of arms to any country involved in a war, and the second will do the same, though some changes have been made due to the new provision. Nations at war will now be able to purchase goods from the United States in addition to weapons and arms. Raw materials such as oil, which is desperately needed by nations with large navies such as the United Kingdom, will be available for purchase, but buyers must not only provide their own ships for transportation, but they are also only permitted to purchase these goods in cash.\n\nWith the cash and carry provisions now included in the Neutrality Act 1937, we will not only be able to support democratic nations in this manner, but we will also make some money, which we hope to put to good use in domestic affairs. The cash and carry provisions currently have a two-year time limit, so whether we choose to renew them later is not a decision we need to make right now."

Senator Hugo Black of the Democratic Party first proposed the bill in 1932, but it was met with strong opposition at the time. This resulted in a revision of Black's original document, which was supported by many senior Bureau of Labor Standards officials.\n\nThe new Act mandates an eight-hour workday and a forty-hour workweek, with workers able to claim wages for up to four hours of overtime worked, as well as being paid the minimum wage. The Act also includes restrictions on what work children can and cannot do, as well as raises for nearly 700,000 workers. Some groups, however, such as executives and seasonal workers, are not covered by this legislation.\n\nThe President declared after signing the Act that it was "the most important piece of New Deal legislation since the Social Security Act of 1935," and it may well prove to be so in the future."

Many isolationist members of Congress saw any revisions to the prior act as a method to pull the United States into a large-scale European battle.\n\nThe law originally intended for a limited re-implementation of "Cash and Carry." The "Cash and Carry" policy permitted hostile countries to buy non-military commodities in exchange for cash and full transportation responsibility.\n\nThat all changed when German tanks crossed the Polish border.\n\nNew clauses in the act allowed the sale of weaponry to warring states; however, the use of loans and American shipping remained barred. As a result of Germany's increasing aggression, many members of Congress changed their opinions, and the bill was carried by a vote of 243-181.\n\nDuring the removal of the weapons embargo, Nebraska Independent Senator George W. Norris was quoted as saying, , “If we repeal it, we are helping England and France. If we fail to repeal it, we will be helping Hitler and his allies.”"

Official reports state that we made a decent amount of money from the scheme, some of which we funneled into our economy and armed forces after providing numerous countries with numerous amounts of raw materials for whatever their purposes may be.\n\nDespite the end of cash and carry, the situation in Europe and other parts of the world, such as Asia, remains extremely tense, with some predicting war at any moment. If we can find a way to help democracies around the world by trading raw materials for cash, the provisions may be useful to bring back in the future, and we will undoubtedly benefit from it."

 USA_Packing_the_Courts.1.t: "The Judicial Procedures Reform Bill"
 USA_Packing_the_Courts.1.d: "The biggest obstacle to implement the progressive legislation necessary to restart the economy and improve the life quality of the American people comes from the Supreme Court. The conservative justices known as ”the Four Horsemen” are attempting to block any legislation regarding the New Deal, using arguments regarding constitutional jurisprudence and legal formalism.\n\nThese excuses, based on archaic formalist and fiscally conservative views are only delaying future economic and social expansion plans. After various failed attempts to introduce legislation regarding this issue, the reelection of President Roosevelt presents a perfect opportunity to reform the federal judiciary.The Judicial Procedures Reform Bill proposed by Roosevelt grants the President the ability to appoint new judges of the Supreme Court for each federal judge that reaches the age of seventy, and didn’t retire within six months.\n\n However, the bill also limits this power to six judges in the Supreme Court and two on the lower federal courts. Also, it establishes proctors on the Supreme Court to administer the lower courts. If we manage to pass the bill, we can finally overcome these obstacles that have been delaying America’s path to a better future."

The population still views the Supreme Court as an institution that protects the values written in the Constitution, and any kind of intervention is perceived as authoritarian and unconstitutional. Some scholars even argued that the bill could be a potential danger to the rights of the people.\n\nThe reaction of the media was very sceptical, even from the newspapers favorable to us, arguing that, while there the bill has some merit, it could also cause a breakdown of the judicial system.

The President started by arguing that fixing the inequalities of the system was necessary to avoid the mistakes that led to the depression, pointing out the effort of Congress to ratify legislation regarding economic recovery.\n\nHe then criticized the Supreme Court for trying to sabotage this legislation. Speaking in metaphorical terms, Roosevelt referred to the American form of government as a three-horse team, describing the judicial system as the third horse that is delaying the other two.\n\nThe President stated the Supreme Court was functioning improperly, misinterpreting the Constitution to follow their agenda. He also listed the advantages of judicial reform, that it will allow for a cheaper, speedier, and effective administration of the system of justice. After empathizing that there is nothing radical on his proposal because it was already a kind of policy implemented by prior presidents, he ended the address by making clear his intention to restore the balance to three branches of power.

Bar associations are lining up against the bill, and the letter to the Congress in opposition are pilling up.\n\nIt is rumored that even Vice President John Nance Garner is going to oppose the bill, with other Conservative Democrats following soon. In addition to this backlash, one Progressive editorialist accused the President of trying to fake an appearance of sincerity on his address to take away the rights of the American people.

The Judiciary Committee of the Senate, which is responsible for the bill and led by Democratic Senator Henry F. Ashurst, is currently holding up this critical piece of legislation. Senator Ashurst is known for being a very skilled public speaker, making thousands of speeches with a varied and sophisticated vocabulary.\n\nBeloved by the people of Arizona, he has a good reputation for putting the interests of his constituents above anything else. However, the Senator is also infamous for constantly switching political positions. His inconsistent and eccentric record tarnish what is otherwise an impeccable career, as he voted both for and against Prohibition and stated contradictory opinions regarding the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill that he is now holding up. To protect our agenda for the president's second term, we must put him under pressure and force him to flip his opinions once more. The fate of our judicial system rests in his hands."

 USA_Packing_the_Courts.6.d: "Senator Ashurst may have his faults, but stubbornness is not one of them. After a little bit of ”encouragement”, the senator has promised to do everything in his power to advance the project. Giving a convincing and passionate speech highlighting the need to modernize the judicial system, Senator Ashurst defended the bill as a ”step in the right direction”. Our fears that the committee could delay it indefinitely have fortunately not materialized for now.

When asked about this slowness, the Arizonian senator bizarrely referred to the motto of the committee: "No haste, no hurry, no waste, no worry”.

It is even rumored than the conservative wing of the Democratic Party are willing to support the bill reluctantly in order to follow the party line.\n\nThere is some opposition coming from bar associations and conservative and progressive newspapers, but fortunately, they are in the minority.

While the death of the senator is already bad for the party leadership, it also hinders the progress of our judicial agenda.\n\nMajority Leader Robinson was not only one of the biggest supporters of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill but of the president's New Deal initiatives, doing everything in his power to get the number of votes necessary. Without him passionately defending the bill and our government, our chances of success are greatly reduced."

Fortunately, he was rushed to a hospital where they managed to stabilize his condition. For now, the Senator will focus on his recovery, but he has promised to get back to the Senate as soon as he can.

 USA_Packing_the_Courts.12.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The ferocious battle to reform the Supreme Court is finally over. The Judicial Procedures Reform Bill was passed on the Senate, allowing the President to appoint new justices to the Supreme Court. Despite many politicians heavily criticizing the bill as an attempt to stack the court through unconstitutional means, most of the Democrats supported the party line and voted in favor of it.\n\nRepublican politicians are furious at the result, calling this bill ”a step further into authoritarianism”. Numerous opponents of the President (including Chief Justice Hughes) have threatened with resignation if these changes are implemented. However, it is believed that his words lack any real substance.\n\nWith Roosevelt's plan for judicial reform implemented, his administration's political capital is at an all-time high, and they are now capable of expanding the New Deal beyond even their most generous expectations.

For now, the judicial reform initiative will likely go back to the committee where the necessary changes will be made to at least pass a modified version of it.\n\nThe loss of political capital that will result from this defeat could even put in danger the integrity of the President's New Deal initiatives, empowering the it's staunch opponents.

 ### The Motives of the Vice President
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.1.t: "The Motives of the Vice President"
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.1.d: "In the aftermath of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill’s defeat, many staffers inside the executive branch have sought to deflect blame, lambasting congressmen for not supporting the President. However, Roosevelt himself has come to a more drastic conclusion, one suggesting meddling from within his own branch of government!\n\nNumerous executives have had troubles with their Vice-President’s over the decades, but Garner and Roosevelt’s relationship has been wrought with mistrust since the second term began! Garner has specifically disagreed with the President on many serious issues, including the Reform Bill! While Garner was crucial to the success of the New Deal at first, the Texan appears to just be much more conservative than we originally thought. Perhaps he has other motives than we currently know.\n\nSomeone must take the fall for the defeat, that much is certain. Several aides are calling for Roosevelt to immediately ask for Garner’s resignation. Removing a significant member of the branch will have serious consequences in soft power for the administration. That being said, Roosevelt has already made up his mind on a new VP pick for a potential third term, so Garner will be departing anyway. Perhaps allowing him to ease out while limiting his press time, would suffice to limit any further damage."
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.1.A: "Demand Garner’s resignation immediately!"
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.1.B: "Ease the Texan out to pasture..."

 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.2.t: "Vice President John Nance Garner Resigns!"
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.2.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Earlier this morning, John Nance Garner, the 32nd Vice President, tendered his resignation to President Roosevelt and the Cabinet at large. Cactus Jack, as he was well known, had once been an invaluable asset to the Administration, providing a link to both the moderate and conservative factions of the Democratic Party. However, by the start of the President’s second term, Garner had begun to openly oppose portions of Roosevelt’s ambitious plans. With his withdrawal of support for the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill and its subsequent defeat in congress, Garner was expected to be replaced at the Democratic Convention at the least. However, his removal now signals exactly where the executive branch places the defeat’s blame.\n\nAt a time when the President needs as much support as he can muster, the resignation will not only open the door to a political battle for a new Vice President, but also make it that much harder to get any more legislation passed. With the more conservative faction of the party now adrift, Roosevelt will need to make a much more difficult decision on his 2nd in Command, and do it very quickly."
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.2.A: "With the Cactus gone, the political desert gets that much drier."
 
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.3.t: "Cactus Jack's Successor"
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.3.d: "While the President has survived the scandal with the courts, several key members of the Roosevelt administration have been forced out following recent events- the most significant of these was Vice President Garner, also known as Cactus Jack. With a crucial part of his cabinet missing, the President now has a position to fill- and a unique opportunity.\n\nPopular in the south and his home state of Texas, Garner was a compromise candidate who brought in votes and appeased the conservative wing of the party. Unfortunately, his vision for America's future was incompatible with the President's. Garner served his purpose, but with electoral victory already behind him, the President has a chance to pick a right-hand man more agreeable with his policy goals.\n\nSecretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace has spent two decades advocating for government intervention in the farming sector and has enthusiastically supported the New Deal since the beginning. As Vice President, he would have considerably more power to assist Roosevelt in implementing his economic program. On the other hand, Secretary of State Cordell Hull is a skilled diplomat with ties to Cactus Jack's old supporters, which could be instrumental in securing the support and votes of conservatives within the party.\n\nCordell Hull or Henry Wallace, pragmatism or idealism- time to play it safe or throw caution to the wind?\n\nThe President turns toward the door to the secretary's office, and Missy LeHand steps through it as if silently summoned. Roosevelt smiles."
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.3.A: "Missy, would you get Secretary Hull on the line?"
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.3.B: "Missy, would you have Secretary Wallace meet me?"

 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.4.t: "Cordell Hull Appointed Vice President"
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.4.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]News from Washington today as President Roosevelt struggles to maintain his momentum after an unsightly string of high-profile resignations. In a brief press conference at the White House, the President announced that Secretary of State Cordell Hull, a native of Tenessee, would leave his position to take up the office of Vice President. Undersecretary Sumner Welles will take Hull's former cabinet post.\n\nMost political pundits view this move as an olive branch to the Moderate wing of the party, which had begun to distance itself from Roosevelt's New Dealers. While this has undoubtedly shored up the President's position in the party somewhat, it seems unlikely that Democrats will ever trust him as they once did."
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.4.A: "A step towards reconciliation, but is it enough?"

 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.5.t: "Henry Wallace Appointed Vice President"
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.5.d: "[USA.GetNewsIcon]President Roosevelt himself is expected to announce the successor to John Nance Garner in a matter of moments. While many Americans already have an idea who will fill the Vice President’s role, many are wondering just how much of a successor he will actually be!\n\nHenry A. Wallace, Secretary of Agriculture, will be elevated to 2nd in Command of the United States. Wallace, a self proclaimed progressive, is the ideological opposite of the former VP, an expected move after his fervent opposition to many of the President’s programs. An ardent supporter of the New Deal and a skilled bureaucrat under the Agricultural Department, Wallace is likely to have a smooth transition into the role, something the Administration needs desperately. Finding a pillar of support outside the mainstream party is crucial to Roosevelt’s election chances, and the executive branch knows that.\n\nHowever, Wallace’s devout liberal tendencies, and somewhat odd personal habits, have made him an easy target for more moderate democrats over the years. Roosevelt is already treading on thin ice after Garner’s removal, with many conservatives already considering propping up another candidate in opposition to the President. It is yet to be seen what will happen at the Convention, but after this likely designation, the Executives will have a steep uphill battle to win control of the party for an unprecedented third term.\n\nMembers of the DNC are now approaching the podium, with the Chairman, Senate and House leaders in attendance.

 ### Army events
 USA_Army.1.t: "The Selective Training Act"
 USA_Army.1.d: "Amidst growing tensions, the United States must be prepared in the event of global war. Upon these shifting tides rests a giant, lightly dozing but slowly opening its eyes. The first peacetime conscription in American history has just been enacted, expected to bring an additional nine-hundred thousand soldiers into the army. All eligible men between the ages of 21 and 45 are subject to the draft, ensuring we have a strong manpower reserve in the event of open warfare. Despite growing complaints, this act has been met with little resistance, with primarily pacifist factions opposing the acts. However, in the end, it is America’s job to uphold global democracy, and thus it shall do so.\nTo stay the steady hand of objection, the act includes a clause regarding conscientious objection, allowing any citizen to deny military service for religious or medical reasons if any are present. Thus, whilst conscription has been implemented in the United States, our army shall remain that of volunteers, ensuring the liberty of Americans as well as those foreigners we deign to protect."
 USA_Army.1.A: "Let us hope we needn't employ such reserves."

 USA_Army.2.t: "Federalization of the National Guard"
 USA_Army.2.d: "Following several years of military buildup, we find ourselves lagging behind in active-duty soldiers for the US Army. That changes now. Though historically the National Guard has fought for individual states, their recent reclassification as members of the US Army in addition to their state role has prepared us to make the final decision to centralize the military. As of today, four-hundred thousand members of the National Guard have been called up to report to their units, effectively doubling the size of the US Army. 18 divisions and various other forces have been federalized for service in this time of national emergency. A rifle is only as good as the man firing it, thus we cannot subsist on industry alone. These hundreds of thousands of trained men will vastly expand the fighting capabilities of the army, ensuring that we will not have to resort to deploying reserves for quite some time."
 USA_Army.2.A: "Let us hope we needn't employ such reserves."
 USA_Army.2.A: "These new soldiers shall win the day."

 USA_Army.3.t: "The Louisiana Maneuvers"
 USA_Army.3.d: "The onset of war seems inevitable for America, and thus we need to get our army into fighting shape. The US Army has not seen active combat since the ending of the Great War, thus we must first evaluate the current logistical and doctrinal status of our main fighting force, some four-hundred thousand soldiers, as well as the effectiveness of our command structure. The plan includes large-scale maneuvers stretching from the Sabine River to the Calcasieu, with dozens of high-ranking officers present to oversee such events. Though such events will be costly, it is necessary to determine the current fighting strength of the army and provide the soldiers some combat experience, even if simply staged. The exercises will pit the red army versus the blue, including armor groups, antitank groups, cavalry flanking divisions, and several air task forces.\nWith the conclusion of the maneuvers, we have learned a great deal. With a possible panzerkampf on the horizon, the necessity of tank destroyers has become apparent, with the majority of our defensive doctrine revolving around knocking out as many tanks as possible. An immobilized enemy cannot fight, and with much of our doctrine focused on mobile envelopment, the odds of an American victory look high."
 USA_Army.3.A: "A modernized American Army awaits."

 USA_Army.4.t: "Eisenhower's Grand Battleplan"
 USA_Army.4.d: "Dwight D. Eisenhower has witnessed many changes in the face of war over the last 20 years. Having served in the Great War, he excelled in demonstrating his brilliant organizational skills, eventually rising to the rank of major after the war. More recently, during the dark days at the start of the Great Depression, when money was tight and the army's budget was low, Eisenhower continued to plan for another war, which we hope never happens.\n\nThis doctrine, simply titled "The Grand Battleplan," argues for extensive planning and organization prior to any fighting, employing a strong defense to break the enemy before launching a massive assault to punch through their lines. Eisenhower also claims that an attack could be bolstered by using mechanized infantry and armored units, with much of the control coming from a single centralized command post.\n\nEisenhower has already proven his worth, and by giving his ideas the green light, we can begin to implement his reforms across the US Army, which will undoubtedly prepare us for any future conflicts that may arise."
 USA_Army.4.A: "Ike will ensure we will have tactical superiority on the battlefield!"

 USA_Army.5.t: "Marshall's Overwhelming Firepower"
 USA_Army.5.d: "Much can be said about George C. Marshall. A strategist, a soldier, and an excellent General, he has spent many years observing how the nature of warfare has changed, and he now may be a part of its future. Marshall spent much of his time as Army Chief of Staff between 1920 and 1924 working on ways to modernize and mechanize warfare, and after years in the making, his new doctrine has been presented to us with a simple, yet effective name: Overwhelming Firepower.\n\nIts main point is that artillery should be used as the driving force behind any attack or defense by our forces. Our infantry units will also try to stall any enemy advances so that by the time they reach our positions, they will be too weak to deal significant damage. Marshall's final plan is to use mechanized forces to blitz through the weakened enemy lines and deal the killing blow to their forces, ensuring victory in our battles.\n\nWhile it is far from perfect, Marshall has stated that he wishes to proceed so that he can implement his plans to identify and eliminate training flaws."
 USA_Army.5.A: "Let hell rain down: fire in the hold!"

 USA_Army.6.t: "Caution: Patton!"
 USA_Army.6.d: "General George S. Patton has been a key figure in the development of the army's armored warfare doctrine since the end of the Great War, serving in a variety of staff positions across the country. Patton's armored warfare doctrine is based on troops' ability to penetrate conventional defensive lines using maneuver by armored units. The use of tanks and related vehicles by other supporting arms such as infantry fighting vehicles, self-propelled artillery, and other combat vehicles, as well as mounted combat engineers and other support units, is critical to the application of armored warfare.\n\nThe doctrine of armored warfare was originally developed to break the static nature of trench warfare on the Western Front during the Great War, but its effectiveness continues to this day. As a result, it is time to embrace the future of warfare and reform our army doctrine to resemble Patton's.\n\nPatton's abilities and effectiveness as a General were demonstrated during the Great War, and his concepts of mechanized and armored warfare continue to impress. That fact, combined with the fear that another conflict is on the horizon, is why Patton has been officially promoted to Field Marshal."

 USA_Army.10.d: "Plunged into the chaos of war once more, America has seen its fair share of hardships, which only goes to steel our resolve. However, resolve alone cannot win a battle. We require adept and experienced leadership, and though we are certainly not short-handed, a veteran officer can just as certainly be useful. John J. Pershing, a four-star General of the Great War, has recently approached the president, offering to put his retirement on hold for the good of the nation. He requests reinstatement to his original rank--certainly not an unreasonable request. The issue arises in his methodology: though Pershing offers deft action and positive results, he brings with him unparalleled losses. A rigid and traditional tactician, we cannot afford to throw our men at the enemy with such carelessness. Is America truly so deprived of officers that we might resort to these methods?"

 USA_Air_Force.1.d: "Claire Lee Chennault, also known as "Old Leatherface", is a military aviator and a fierce advocate of "pursuit" or fighter-interceptor aircraft. He learned to fly in the Army Air Service during World War I and following the war he graduated from pursuit pilot training at Ellington Field, Texas, and remained in the service after it became the Air Corps in 1926. Chennault became the Chief of Pursuit Section at Air Corps Tactical School.\n\nHe has been attempting to modernize fighter tactics by emphasizing the use of airpower as a weapon. As a result, he frequently disagreed with and criticized General Joseph Stilwell for being overly reliant on infantry and underestimating the capabilities of airpower.\n\nWe have decided that Chennault is correct and that we must modernize our fighters as soon as possible in order to provide the airpower we require."
 USA_Air_Force.1.A: "We will dominate the skies."

 USA_Air_Force.2.t: "The Proper Composition Of the Air Force"
 USA_Air_Force.2.d: "George Churchill Kenney enlisted as a flying cadet in the Aviation Section of the United States Signal Corps in 1917 and served in the First World War, where he fought off German fighters and shot two of them down. After the war, he was commissioned into the Regular Army in 1920, where he attended the Air Corps Tactical School and later became an instructor. He was in charge of the acceptance of Martin NBS-1 bombers and even test flew them. He also devised methods for mounting.30 caliber machine guns on the wings of an Airco DH.4 aircraft.\n\nHe favors close air support and opposes the US focusing on strategic bombing, as proposed by Harold Lee George and his Bomber Mafia. He believes that the primary goal of the Air Force should be to support ground forces with fighters and light bombers by conducting airstrikes against hostile targets close to friendly forces.\n\nAlthough theorists and aviators frequently disagree about its strategic value, the close air support doctrine advances steadily. We've decided that, with Kenney's help, we'll begin shifting our air doctrine toward close air support."
 USA_Air_Force.2.A: "Supporting our ground forces is key."

 USA_Air_Force.3.t: "The Bomber Mafia Succeeds"
 USA_Air_Force.3.d: "When it comes to our Air Force, it is obvious that Harold Lee George and his Bomber Mafia have the right idea on what we should be focusing on.\n\nGeorge is one of our most capable Air Force Generals and an aviation pioneer and outspoken proponent of the industrial web theory. He believes that an enemy's industrial power can be attacked at weak points, potentially severely limiting the enemy's ability to wage a long war, as well as his morale and will to resist. He assisted in the refinement of precision daylight bomber doctrine and taught air tactics and precision bombing doctrine himself, eventually becoming the de facto leader of the powerful "Bomber Mafia." Together with Bomber Mafia members, George researched, debated, and codified "industrial web theory," which the men believed would be a war-winning strategy.\n\nWe will begin to listen to George and implement his industrial web theory, focusing heavily on bombers and vigorously promoting precision bombing doctrine."
 USA_Air_Force.3.A: "First, we destroy their industry, then their morale."

 USA_Air_Force.4.t: "Hap Arnold's Compromise"
 USA_Air_Force.4.d: "When it comes to our Air Force, Henry Harley Arnold, also known as \"Hap\" to his work associates, has the right idea on what we should be focusing on.\n\nArnold is widely regarded as a visionary who first articulated the importance of superior research and development capabilities in deterring and winning wars. His ideas have played an important role within the Air Force, and he has quickly risen through the ranks. Arnold promoted research and development, and some of his projects included the B-17 and the concept of jet-assisted takeoff.\n\nHe describes his wartime research and development philosophy as follows: \"Make some quality sacrifices in order to obtain enough quantity to supply all fighting units. Never follow the mirage of the perfect airplane to the point where fighting squadrons are short of fighter planes.\" Instead of focusing too much on quality or other types of planes such as bombers, he believes that we should first focus on having a large enough Air Force with enough fighters to assist and supply all fighting units.\n\nWe will start listening to Arnold and implement his ideas of focusing heavily on fighters in our Air Force."

The individual was none other than Clyde Barrow himself. Farris opened the door as he approached the steps, at the command of the officers. Clyde begged Farris not to shoot, but when he saw the officers in the front room, he pulled a sawed-off shotgun from under his coat and fired through the front window.Davis, who had been stationed on the back porch, heard the commotion and ran for the front of the house as the officers inside returned fire. When Davis saw Clyde, he ordered him to drop his weapon while drawing his pistol. Clyde was the first to react, firing a volley of buckshot into Davis's chest.

While Barrow and Parker were attempting to meet with family members near Sowers, Texas, Dallas Sheriff Smoot Schmid, Deputy Bob Alcorn, and Deputy Ted Hinton waited nearby.\n\nBarrow sensed a trap as he approached and drove past his family's car, at which point Schmid and his deputies jumped to their feet and opened fire with machine guns and a BAR. The family members caught in the crossfire escaped unharmed, but a BAR bullet is suspected of striking both Barrow and Parker's legs. They escaped later that night.\n\nShortly after, a Dallas grand jury indicted Parker and Barrow for the murder of Tarrant County Deputy Malcolm Davis 10 months earlier, which is Parker's first murder warrant."

The search for Barrow and Parker has now enlisted the full force of both the Texas and federal governments. Lee Simmons, the prison's chief, has promised that anyone involved in the escape will be tracked down and killed.\n\nFormer Texas Ranger Captain Frank Hamer was approached by the Texas Department of Corrections and persuaded to go after the Barrow Gang.

Even before this announcement, Huey Long is by far the most popular senator in the south, if not the entire country. Deep from the bayous of Louisiana, Long is a firm isolationist and a staunch populist. A man with a mighty ambition and a hand on the pulse of the nation, some expect him to be the match that will set the whole 1936 Democratic Nomination tinderbox, afire. It would appear, to some, that this announcement is the firebrand to start the whole inferno.\n\nIn a full national radio address, crisscrossing the wires during primetime last night, Senator Long introduced his ‘Share Our Wealth’ plan, an intricate program designed to raise the national standard of living for all citizens. By capping personal fortunes at $50 million dollars, restructuring the federal tax code into a progressive hierarchy and limiting annual income to $1 million dollars a year, Long promoted a vision of an America for the people and not just the top hands of society. While the newspapers, owned by those who would be directly impacted by these cuts, lambasted Long as a communist buffoon, the common folks are roaring with approval and jubilation.\n\nTie all that in with public works spending, free higher education and veteran and old-age pensions, Long has effectively just propelled himself to the 36’ democratic nomination in an instant. Roosevelt has a long fight to the nomination ahead of him if he wishes to keep the Kingfish where he belongs, downstream."

Even at the lowest point of the depression, thirty thousand cab drivers made their rounds around Midtown and the Upper East Side- with so many drivers and little regulation, fares went down. Finally, when the new "Nickel tax" cut into their already meager pay, cabbies began to turn their famous anger towards their bosses and the city government.\n\nThe drivers' strike has shut down all of New York City, with around 15,000 strikers refusing to take rides and blocking roads with their cars. The New York Times has reported several violent altercations between the strikers and independent drivers, clashes between the strikers and the NYPD, and even street brawls with fed-up commuters.\n\nThese events have served as a trial by fire for newly elected mayor Fiorello La Guardia, who took office less than a month ago. City hall has come out in firm support of the strikers, refusing to issue driver's licenses as a measure to prevent the hiring of scabs. While this gesture could form the basis of a settlement, the chaos in the Big Apple is far from over."

A squad from the metropolitan police force searched the flagpole and a copy of *The Harvard Lampoon* found nearby for fingerprints but have so far not acquired any leads on the identity of the prankster. *The Harvard Lampoon* was emblazoned with an article titled \"Down With Capitalism\" making law enforcement believe that the suspect must be from some collegian in the neighborhood. The flag is thought to have been raised stealthily sometime between 4:00 and 4:20 A.M. while a guard was making his rounds.\n\nThe removal of the flag was just as comical, as the miscreant had knotted and cut the halyards in such a way that the flag would not be moved by conventional means.

Two years later, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was among those who supported Smith in an ultimately unsuccessful bid for the Democratic Party Ticket. Roosevelt threw his weight behind Smith once more in 1928, where he won the Democratic primary but lost the presidency to Herbert Hoover. That same year Roosevelt ran for governor of New York at Smith's request, winning by a margin of less than 1%. Roosevelt's star continued to rise while Smith's did not, culminating in the triumph of his progressive wing over Smith and the party's conservatives in the 1932 and 1936 primaries.\n\nMany see Smith's defection as a sign that the conservative wing of the Democratic Party is losing patience with Roosevelt and the New Deal but find themselves powerless to combat the progressives within their own organization.

Parrish had received an amount less than the $14.50 per week of 48 hours that had been set as a minimum wage by the Welfare Committee and Supervisor of Women in Industry according to Washington state law. Earlier in the trial court, the case was ruled for the owner of the Cascadian Hotel, West Coast Hotel Company, using Adkins v. Children's Hospital as precedent. Adkins had set the precedent that a minimum wage legislation for women was an unconstitutional infringement of liberty of contract which was protected by the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Parrish appealed, and the Washington Supreme Court reversed the decision of the trial court and ruled in favor of Parrish, after which West Coast Hotel Co. appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nChief Justice Charles E. Hughes delivered a surprise 5-4 decision in favor of Parrish. Hughes and the majority ruled that the Constitution permitted the restriction of liberty of contract by state law to protect the health and ability to support oneself.

The mighty Iron Horse, who at his peak hit forty-nine home runs in a single season five years ago, shocked the crowd and umpires alike with the announcement before the Bronx Bombers took the field at Briggs Stadium for their first game against the Detroit Tigers this year.\n\nWith the consent of Manager Joe McCarthy, Gehrig himself brought out the pregame lineup card that officially ended his streak, because he, perhaps better than anybody else, recognized his competitive decline and was frankly aware of the fact he was doing the Yankees no good defensively or on offense. He last played Sunday in New York against the Washington Senators.\n\nWhen Gehrig will start another game is undetermined. He will not be used as a pinch-hitter and the present plan is to keep him on the bench to relax and shake off the mental fatigue he admittedly has encountered this season. He may swing into action in the hot weather, which should have a beneficial effect upon his tired muscles."

The film, based on a 1936 novel of the same name by Margaret Mitchell, is set against the backdrop of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction era. The film tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara, the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner, following her romantic pursuit of Ashley Wilkes, who is married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, and her subsequent marriage to Rhett Butler.\n\nThe film has been faced with a famously troubled production, being forced to delay filming for two years until January 1939 because of Selznick's determination to secure Gable for the role of Rhett. Simultaneously, the role of Scarlett was difficult to cast, with 1,400 unknown women auditioning for the part. The original screenplay by Sidney Howard also underwent many revisions by several writers in order to reduce it to a suitable length. Post-production concluded in November 1939, just a month before its release.\n\nThough criticized for its long length, the film clocking in at over 3 and half hours, their troubles seem to have paid off.

 #Cash and Carry Events
 USA_Cash_and_Carry.1.t: "The USA Offers Fighters"
 USA_Cash_and_Carry.1.d: "The United States may still be in isolation, but that hasn’t stopped the president from selling equipment to friendly nations. They’ve recently offered us fighter planes in support of the Royal Airforce, as a gesture of cooperation between us. However, there is a catch: we will have to pay upfront for the fighters and deliver them ourselves. It could be a bit costly at the moment, but ready-to-go planes are a much better investment than rushing new ones through production lines. What should we tell them?"
 USA_Cash_and_Carry.1.A: "It’s a deal!"
 USA_Cash_and_Carry.1.B: "We’ll manufacture our own planes, thank you."

 USA_Cash_and_Carry.2.t: "Britain Declines"
 USA_Cash_and_Carry.2.d: "We received an unexpected answer from England on our offer of new fighters. Although affordable and much needed on their end, they decided that their money and merchant ships would be better used elsewhere. It’s not too big of a deal, but if the deal had gone through, it would’ve been a great boost for the economy and the aviation industry. Oh well, it’s their choice if they want planes to defend their island, not ours. Plus, we get to hang onto our fighters for other cooperating business partners. "
 USA_Cash_and_Carry.2.A: "We were only trying to help, after all."

 USA_Cash_and_Carry.3.t: "Britain Accepts!"
 USA_Cash_and_Carry.3.d: "Great Britain, perpetually in need of new fighters as the air war intensifies over Europe, has accepted our offer of over 200. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the Cash and Carry policy, we cannot allow the planes to be flown to Britain from US soil. Cash and Carry is the policy that allows the sale of war materiel to belligerents, as long as the recipients arrange for the transport using their own ships and pay immediately in cash.\n\nIn theory, this policy continues forwards our larger policy of neutrality on the current conflict over in Europe, as all sides are treated equally in terms of trading war materials. In practice, the policy was designed intentionally so as to advantage the allies, who were most likely to be able to control sea lanes and send ships to pick up products. In this instance however, it means that getting these fighters to England will take a little longer than expected. Fortunately, we share one of the longest borders on Earth with a nation that can send those fighters to Great Britain."

 USA_Department_of_War.1.t: "The Manhattan Project"
 USA_Department_of_War.1.d: "Philip Turner's job is straightforward. He spends the entire day standing in front of a gauge, and when it reaches a hundred, he opens a valve to release the pressure in the pipe. When all of the pressure has been released, he tightens the valve again and repeats the process. He does have to wear special shielding to do the work, but the pay is good and the work is simple. Philip is unsure of the purpose of his work. He is not required to understand.\n\nIn reality, Philip is enriching uranium for a project at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the American West. The project, officially codenamed Development of Substitute Materials, was authorised earlier this year by President Roosevelt to pursue two lines of development exploring the potential explosive capabilities of uranium and the recently discovered plutonium. It is also in charge of gathering information on the German nuclear energy project.\n\nCertain voices in the scientific community have been debating the feasibility of such a uranium bomb for several years. It has been suggested that a bomb of this type could harness the explosive power of thousands of tonnes of TNT. As of now, the project's ability to produce any significant results is unknown. Much of the money is currently being spent on just building the facilities needed to enrich uranium to the level required for research. However, if information about the German nuclear project is correct, there may be a real need to develop this weapon."
 USA_Department_of_War.1.A: "To become Death."

 USA_Department_of_War.2.t: "The Joint Chiefs of Staff"
 USA_Department_of_War.2.d: "The United States military has the potential to be a formidable combat force capable of projecting hard power in both Europe and Asia. We almost certainly can, thanks to the strength of 132 million willing Americans at home and one of the world's largest economies. However, in order for our military to be capable of handling a large-scale war like the current one on two fronts, it will need to become significantly more organised.\n\nThe British Chiefs of Staff Committee has long provided effective administrative, tactical, and strategic direction to British forces throughout their global empire. A system like this enables each branch of the military to effectively coordinate with one another and determine the broad strategic strokes required to win the war or achieve any other goal set before it.\n\nOurs will be structured similarly. The Joint Chiefs of Staff will be the supreme military body in the United States for strategic direction. This joint committee will have four members: one from the army, one from the navy, one from the army air corps, and a special military advisor to the military who will also serve as Chief of Staff to the Commanders in Chief of the Army and Navy."
 USA_Department_of_War.2.A: "“A general is just as good or just as bad as the troops under his command make him.”"

 USA_Department_of_War.3.t: "The Office of Strategic Services"
 USA_Department_of_War.3.d: "Military intelligence is one of the most valuable assets one can have in a war. All the planes and men in the world are useless if you do not know when and where to deploy them. Unfortunately, in that regard, the US has fallen behind. Other agencies, like those of MI6 or the Abwehr have given their respective countries valuable information that has advanced their respective war efforts.\n\nTo that end, the US will be establishing its own intelligence agency, the Office of Strategic Services. The OSS will be tasked with providing a worldwide overview of the German war effort, its strengths and weaknesses, as well as assisting the military with any covert operations that need to be done. Such operations will include performing acts of sabotage, waging propaganda war, organizing and coordinating resistance groups, and providing military training for guerrilla movements, among other things.\n\nThough still nascent, our allies’ intelligence agencies will help us develop our organization’s connections globally, in addition to our existing ties to rebel groups and opposing forces in Europe and Asia. With our major OSS training site, codenamed Shangri-La, already built and operational, it is only a matter of time before OSS agents start seeing deployment in the field."
 USA_Department_of_War.3.A: "“He who knows the enemy and himself will never in a hundred battles be at risk.”"

 USA_Department_of_War.4.t: "The National Security Act"
 USA_Department_of_War.4.d: "With the war over, we must look into the structure of our armed forces. A unified department in charge of the military branches of services must be established if we want to prevent another Pearl Harbor from happening again, so our lack of preparedness and coordination between services must be addressed. Adding on to this change, we should also grant more independence for our air force by giving them their own department so resource allocation and management within the defense department can be better streamlined to reach a more effective result. A centralized intelligence agency should also be established in favor of coordinating information from different branches of service."
 USA_Department_of_War.4.A: "Now we will be better prepared for whoever comes next"

 USA_Department_of_War.5.t: "The US Department of War"
 USA_Department_of_War.5.d: "Unfortunately, the old office where our Department of War was previously located, which was in the State, War, and Navy Building has been “acquired” by the Department of State. Now we need a whole new location for our Department of War’s office. Temporarily we plan to locate them to the Munitions Buildings which was built in 1918, but this will not work forever. We must plan for a new, long-lasting building to locate Department into, as their work to manage our ground base military assets are too important to be hindered by the lack of an office, meaning that we should find a better solution as soon as possible."

As they approached Hiroshima, Watanabi and his pilot could see that most of the city had been reduced to rubble, and flames had engulfed most of whatever was remaining.\n\nWatanabe could feel a lump in his throat as he stared at the destruction. He felt his breathing slow down nearly to a halt. As he began thinking of what this meant for the war, Watanabe heard soft sobbing.\n\nTurning to his pilot, Watanabe could see the young boy crying.\n\"I know, kid. The destruction.... it's....\" he couldn't find the right words to measure the level of annihilation.\n\"Sir, my mother w-was here.... I-I don't know if she g-got out....\" the pilot wept.\nWatanabe felt the lump in his throat turn into a sinking feeling in his stomach.\n\nHe decided to let the pilot cry it out as they circled the cloud of smoke.

She could hear the other ministers murmuring amongst themselves as she walked over to the Prime Minister, Kantaro Suzuki. She turned to leave the room after handing over the telegram she had come to deliver to the Prime Minister.\n\nThe debate went on. "If only the atomic bomb could dissolve a fraction of your ego like it did that city," Minister Togo retorted, "thousands of Japanese people might be spared!"\n"I'd rather shoot myself in the head than surrender to the Westerners! Our entire existence is based on honour and tradition, we simply cannot surr-"\n\n"Gentlemen!" exclaimed the Prime Minister, effectively silencing everyone in the room.

### New Deal
 USA_New_Deal_Category: "The New Deal"
 USA_New_Deal_Category_desc: "\n\n\n£decision_header_USA_WPA£\n\n\n\nThe WPA, or the Works Progress Administration is a government agency formed as part of President Roosevelt’s New Deal program. This agency intends to help relieve the effects of the Great Depression by employing and putting to work the millions of unskilled laborers and workers who are currently experiencing poverty and hardship throughout the country. The public works projects that they will work on will not only provide them with a satisfactory income that they can live on but revitalise the ageing and inadequate infrastructure that our nation currently possesses."

 USA_The_First_100_Days: "The First 100 Days"
 USA_The_First_100_Days_desc: "As the Great Depression persists, the state of the economy and our country worsens, but with our new president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, hopefully, things will start to change for the better. To kickstart the president’s ambitious plans for the country, he intends to use his first 100 days in office to pass new initiatives that will hopefully counter the effects of this crisis and generate some political momentum that will last for the next four years.\n\nIf however, the president doesn’t enact programs that combat the most pressing issues in the country, his presidency will be off to a rocky start that will have some serious consequences on his ability to put forward and ratify his bold agenda for the future."

 USA_Public_Works_in_the_Northeast: "Public Works in the Northeast"
 USA_Public_Works_in_the_Northeast_desc: "Even though the Northeast hasn't been hit as hard by the Depression as the South or Midwest, mainly due to its more urban character opposed to an industrial or agricultural one, economical instability still has managed to drive thousands of businesses into bankruptcy and millions of workers into unemployment alongside them. To improve the situation in the birthplace of the United States, the WPA will have to be expanded even further, to provide jobs to increasingly restless masses."
 USA_Public_Works_in_the_Midwest: "Public Works in the Midwest"
 USA_Public_Works_in_the_Midwest_desc: "The Midwest was the leading region in both industry and farming, but now with the Great Depression in full swing, the region is on the verge of collapse. Most of the industrial workers are unable to maintain their families and the farmers from the SW corner are desperate left without either home or food because of the Dust Bowl.\nWe should be quick to expand the WPA into the region as a way to maintain the people until either the farming can be started again or the Great Depression recedes."
 USA_Public_Works_in_the_South: "Public Works in the South"
 USA_Public_Works_in_the_South_desc: "The American South has never been a rich region and now with the Great Depression in full swing, the state is plagued by poverty and unemployment on a scale never seen before, with farms closing down left and right, factories going out of business and thousands being left homeless, hungry and jobless.\nIt should be our number one priority to expand the WPA to the South to once again revitalize the region by providing jobs, new infrastructure and a way out of the poverty gripping the Southern States"
 USA_Public_Works_in_the_West: "Public Works in the West"
 USA_Public_Works_in_the_West_desc: "While most of the western regions have fared better than others during the depression, expanding the WPA to states like California, Washington, Oregon and Nevada must be a priority for this administration. Major infrastructure projects like dams, reservoirs and irrigation programs can be built to bolster farmlands and provide rural electricity to farmers in the Rockies. Moreover, public works such as national parks and forests could be created to preserve the natural beauty and wonder of the American West."

 Herbert_Hoover_desc: "Businessman, politician, and humanitarian, if these words were used to describe an American it would be Herbert Clerk Hoover.\n\nWhen Hoover graduated from Stanford University in 1895, he was hired by Bewick, Moreing & Co., a London-based company, to help operate gold mines in Western Australia. In 1908, he left Bewick, Moreing to become an independent London-based mining consultant and financier. He co-founded the Zinc Corporation to extract zinc near Broken Hill, Australia and helped increase copper production in Kyshtym, Russia. By 1914, He had amassed an impressive fortune. After the outbreak of the Great War, Hoover became the head of the Commission for Relief in Belgium, a relief organization that provided food to occupied Belgium until the U.S. entered the war. In 1917, President Woodrow Wilson appointed Hoover to head the Food Administration, and Hoover became known as America's "Food Czar". After the war, Hoover led the American Relief Administration to provide food for the inhabitants of newly formed nations in Central and Eastern Europe. After the 1920 election, President Warren G. Harding appointed Hoover as Secretary of Commerce. Soon Hoover became influential in the development of radio and air travel and he led the federal response to the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, which had earned him wide acclaim for his role in the crisis. \n\nDue to his popularity, Hoover easily won the presidency in 1928. He opposed government intervention on the economy because he thought they infringed upon American ideals of individual freedom and self-reliance. After a few years, Hoover's approval rating has gone down the toilet as he was incapable of creating policies to address issues plaguing the nation, like the Wall Street Crash and Prohibition. Due to this, he lost in the recent election to a Democratic candidate, Franklin D. Roosevelt. Hoover's disastrous presidency severely damaged the image and popularity of the Republican Party."

 USA_The_Great_Depression: "Aftermath of Black Thursday"
 USA_The_Great_Depression_desc: "Years ago, the sprawling metropolis of New York City was dazzling with unprecedented levels of wealth and prosperity. Everyone was throwing money left and right, purchasing the latest cars coming out of Ford and General Motors like it was purchasing paper. It was a time of champagnes and parties, but that was long ago. Hubris caught up with Wall Street, and their newfound wealth vanished in a blink of an eye. It did not help when Hoover, the so-called poster boy of Free Market Capitalism, still insisted that the Free Market shall rebound and repair itself, even as his country's citizens struggle to make ends meet.\n\nThe entirety of America is counting on us to swiftly end this crisis, let's not disappoint them. $UNEMPLOYMENT_EFFECTS$"

 USA_The_Great_Depression_2: "Economic Mobilization"
 USA_The_Great_Depression_2_desc: "As a result of the war, our economy, which has been in shambles since the Great Depression, has undergone unprecedented upheaval. Even though our efforts were successful in mitigating the majority of the effects of the depression, there has been persistent unemployment and poor growth.\n\nThis changed almost immediately. As a result of the war, our industry had flourished throughout the United States. Volunteers are lining up at the Red Cross, factories are packed, and businesses are expanding into the war industry. Every region of the country has begun to produce trucks, planes, and weapons. Our unemployment rate is expected to fall dramatically as a result of this new, revitalised economy. Despite the fact that a greater threat exists, our once-destroyed economy is now nothing more than a distant memory. $UNEMPLOYMENT_EFFECTS$"

 USA_Restore_Confidence_in_the_Banks_desc: "One of the primary reasons for the Great Depression was the widespread panic about the American banking system due to fears over the strength of the institutions. Bank runs, sudden demands by large numbers of customers to withdraw all their funds at almost the same time, brought down many banking corporations as depositors attempted to withdraw more money than the bank had available. In order to win back the public’s trust and to encourage them to deposit their money, the Federal government will be creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Although the new organization has many duties, its prime objective will be to provide insurance to depositors in both commercial and savings banks, and it will be aided in its efforts by the US Department of Treasury, who will be providing a direct line of credit."

 USA_The_Lochner_Era: "The Lochner Era"
 USA_The_Lochner_Era_desc: "Aptly named after the controversial ”Lochner vs New York” labor law case, the term ”Lochner Era” has become synonymous with the Supreme Court's common practice of striking down any economic laws which, in the court's eye, infringe on economic liberty or private contract rights. While this has been common practice since 1897, a variety of economists and politicians have begun criticizing the Supreme Court, arguing that the current economic crisis can only be solved by government intervention in the economy.\nHowever, it currently seems that any future president who seeks to solve this blatant case of judicial activism will have to fight extensively against both the Supreme Court and the corporations who greatly profit from the continued laissez-faire economy in the United States."

 USA_Houdini_in_the_House_desc: "Franklin Delano Roosevelt has been elected to the office of the presidency in the time of one of the greatest economic crises ever, the Great Depression, which promises to be the downfall of our nation if not dealt with properly. The new president has promised a ”New Deal,” for the American people, a series of reforms that if implemented correctly, could prove to be the miracle that many across the country have prayed for. Whether Roosevelt is the magician who can solve America's problems is yet to be seen, but a strong start in these "first one hundred days" will be crucial if he is to gather the momentum needed to pursue some of his more radical ideas in the future, and turn around this country in shambles."

 USA_the_Good_Neighbour: "The Good Neighbor"
 USA_the_Good_Neighbour_desc: "Time and time again American leaders have resorted to brute military force and interventionist policies to fulfill American interests, which have greatly damaged America’s credibility in Latin American countries. President Roosevelt, favors his predecessor's non-interventionist policies, in an effort to denounce past U.S. interventionism and subdue any subsequent fears of Latin Americans, the president has announced during his inaugural address, to dedicate the nation to the policy of ”The Good Neighbor”, the neighbor who respects himself and respects the rights of others, the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a World of neighbors. This policy aims for friendly relationships between the United States and Central as well as South American countries, to foster ties and economic exchanges, this would create new economic opportunities in the form of reciprocal trade agreements and in a sense reassert the influence of the United States in Latin America in a friendly manner."

 USA_Shore_up_Banks: "Shore up the Banks"
 USA_Shore_up_Banks_desc: "We are living a hard time, the Great Depression rages on and people are getting desperate. Banking has always been built on trust and guarantees, but right now, they don't have either of that, as people rush to withdraw their deposits, in fear that banks may close, and in fact provoking serious cash shortages that may lead to the temporal closure of some of the banks.\n\nWe need to mobilize federal reserves to supply cash and create deposit insurance, thus helping banks regain the trust of the people and stopping the bank runs. If we don't do this, this situation could spiral out of control and lead us to a capital shortage and further the economic recession."

 USA_Employment_for_the_Youth_desc: "The path of any nation is based upon the hopes and dreams of it’s youngest generations. With the economy in shambles and unemployment so high, our maturing young adults have a particularly bleak outlook for the future. Therefore, we should resolve to create a public work relief program, already known as the Civilian Conservation Corps, or CCC. The agency will ensure we can provide stable pay and good labor to those looking to work while guaranteeing the conservation of America’s stunning landscape and the development of her natural resources in rural areas."

 USA_Alleviate_Household_Unemployment: "Alleviate Household Unemployment"
 USA_Alleviate_Household_Unemployment_desc: "Beyond the youth unemployment situation, many who were already in the workforce have been humiliated by layoffs and company restructures. Somewhat like the Civilian Conservation Corps, creating the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) would provide a pathway for positions within the federal government. While these would be basic jobs in newly established public lands and facilities, the importance lies in the self-esteem and psychological benefits of having a secure vocation and restoring trust in the United States’ government."

 USA_Provide_Aid_and_Relief: "Provide Aid and Relief"
 USA_Provide_Aid_and_Relief_desc: "Furthering the successful alphabet agencies of the New Deal, the Federal Surplus Commodities Corporation, despite its lengthy name, has a simple objective: Diverting excess agricultural products away from the open market and directly to starving Americans. It seems counter-productive, but at present, many consumables are stagnating in warehouses, due to a massive stockpile from farmers unable to sell at competitive prices. Using the FSCC, we can use federal money to purchase the extras and distribute them to families who desperately need them. Less waste, more haste."

 USA_Drinks_on_the_House_desc: "Brought in to prevent alcohol-related issues such as alcoholism and domestic violence from occurring, the prohibition of the production, importation, transportation and sale of alcohol, or the Eighteenth Amendment, has been effective in that regard. However, it has inadvertently caused some other problems due to it’s ineffective and uneven enforcement. The law has resulted in an increase in crime and has made the general populace agitated and disgruntled, which is not something we want considering the circumstances our nation finds itself in. To keep our country united in these trying times, and acquire more support for our government, we should make the obvious choice and repeal the amendment."

 USA_Raise_Food_Prices: "Raise Food Prices"
 USA_Raise_Food_Prices_desc: "In order to further the economic recovery, being able to provide food on the table is a source of great American pride. While the Agricultural Adjustment Act was a good start, further value manipulation is needed to restore trust in goods. Raising the prices ever so slightly would provide a scarcity effect, thereby stabilizing the supply and demand of foodstuffs. This way, the cost of certain items would remain the same over a longer period of time and not fluctuate from week to week. A small act to return faith in the open market."

 USA_Push_Public_Works_Budget: "Boost the Public Works Budget"
 USA_Push_Public_Works_Budget_desc: "As the global Great Depression continues, several new economic theories have emerged. The most prominent of these, the school of Keynesian Economics, has the seemingly counterintuitive idea that the best way to recover from our economic woes is to start spending. Keynesians suggest that during recessions, the most important influence on economic output is demand, rather than supply, and that the government can stimulate demand by spending money on public works projects.\n\nBy investing large amounts of money into infrastructure projects like new schools, roads, bridges, airports, hospitals, and dams, we can provide our nation's workers with steady jobs and decent pay. With their most basic needs taken care of, Americans will finally be able to spend again, putting customers back in long-shuttered stores."

 USA_Reduce_Agricultural_Surplus: "Reduce Agricultural Surplus"
 USA_Reduce_Agricultural_Surplus_desc: "While the FSCC deals with the surplus food at a higher level, the difficult issue must be attacked at the roots. The Agricultural Adjustment Act is designed to do just that. Once passed, it will subsidize farmers to NOT plant on certain sections of their lands. Furthermore, the government will buy excess livestock in order to keep the prices of cattle competitive. While we are hoping farmers will be able to rally and profit after the depression ends, it is vital we make sure that overproduction does not halt initial agricultural gains. After such a disastrous economic collapse, we must relearn to walk before we can run."

 USA_Invest_in_Public_Works_desc: "The Wealth of America is not just in her cities, her vast geography remains her biggest blessing. With the hardships of the depression, many important civil construction projects have been shelved indefinitely. This has provided another opportunity for getting Americans back to work. Included in the National Industrial Recovery Act, the Public Works Administration will provide contracts to private construction companies to hire unemployed construction workers and begin creating these projects. Roads, schools, railroads, hydroelectric dams, bridges and airports are only a few of the potential proposals for the administration. More than wealth, however, it could prove a multiplier for the stagnant economy, raising the future prospects of the nation as a whole."

 USA_Civil_Works_Administration_desc: "Many citizens have lost their jobs and are currently unemployed because of the Great Depression, the President has thought of and intends to implement policies that over a period of time will bring back prosperity to the nation and its habitants. But these policies are long in coming and implementation, the average citizen needs work as soon as possible if he is to survive these testing times. As part of the ”New Deal” being implemented nationwide, the President has decreed the formation of the Civil Works Administration to generate short term jobs for the most affected echelons of the society, the CWA will provide manual work to many by undertaking several public works and construction projects, though a solution, it is suitable for a short term duration only, instead the nation requires long term policies by the Federal government to be able to fully ever eliminate mass unemployment."

 USA_Protect_Currency: "Protect the Dollar"
 USA_Protect_Currency_desc: "As part of the New deal reforms aimed at combating the effects of the Great Depression in the country, the President has decided to pass the Gold Reserve Act. With the passage of this act the statutory price of gold will be increased, incentivizing imports of gold into the country, for whose accumulation the US Department of Treasury will be responsible. The act while encouraging gold miners all over the world to sell their gold in the USA will also devalue the dollar and hence reduce deflation. The increase in gold reserves will lead to an increase of the money supply in the Country, allowing for the counteracting of the ill effects of the current economic turmoil by the administration."

 USA_Blue_Eagle_Campaing_desc: "Symbols can be more than just a representation. Much like flags, under the right conditions, they can be a rallying point for entire societies. The Blue Eagle is just one of those cases. Originally created to mobilize political support for the new department, it is displayed in factories and shops, by companies, to show compliance or support for the National Recovery Administration. Provided to many employers, posters, letterheads and many other items are promoting a return to national pride in work. The Eagle also has an advertising effect, with many Americans only buying products that proudly display the image on their labels. It has been a smashing success, another badge of American resolve and restoration in the nation."

 USA_Provide_Affordable_Power_desc: "Even by Depression standards, the Tennessee Valley of the southern states is in extremely dire economic conditions. Forests are burned each year by fire, and the best timber has already been slashed and sapped. Depleted farms and fields have ruined the agricultural prospects, leading to some families having an annual income of less than $100. With malaria rates creeping in the low 30%, outside observations of third world settings are difficult to reject. Creating a federal corporation, specifically for the valley, would spur new economic opportunities. Rural electrification, large infrastructure projects and promoting better cultivation methods would go a long way to empowering and modernizing the American south."

 USA_Abandon_Gold_Standard: "Abandon the Gold Standard"
 USA_Abandon_Gold_Standard_desc: "By tying the dollar to gold, we are not giving ourselves the best chance possible of recovering from the Great Depression. The gold standard has forced the government to keep interest rates high in order to protect the gold reserves, but this has made it too expensive for people to borrow. This situation must be resolved immediately. Once we abandon the gold standard, we will then be able to print more money and lower interest rates, which should hopefully stimulate the economy, and bring us back on track."

 USA_Reduce_Fraudulent_Wall_Street_Activities: "Reduce Fraudulent Wall Street Activities"
 USA_Reduce_Fraudulent_Wall_Street_Activities_desc: "Right now in the country, the sale of securities is regulated by state laws termed as ”Blue Sky Laws”. These laws only allow the offering and sale of securities on a purely ”merit review” basis, making investment in new and upcoming businesses very prohibitive. The federal government in an attempt to create better ”disclosure” for investors, curb some of the unethical practices prevalent in the market and to reencourage investment by the public has decided to pass the Federal Securities Act. The law as part of the ”New Deal” by the President will in essence allow investments into any and all public companies, as long as all the necessary information is provided to the prospective investor."

 USA_Restore_Confidence_in_the_Banks: "Restore Confidence in the Banks"
 USA_Restore_Confidence_in_the_Banks_desc: "One of the primary reasons for the Great Depression was the widespread panic about the American banking system due to fears over the strength of the institutions. Bank runs, sudden demands by large numbers of customers to withdraw all their funds at almost the same time, brought down many banking corporations as depositors attempted to withdraw more money than the bank had available. In order to win back the public’s trust and to encourage them to deposit their money, the Federal government will be creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Although the new organization has many duties, its prime objective will be to provide insurance to depositors in both commercial and savings banks, and it will be aided in its efforts by the US Department of Treasury, who will be providing a direct line of credit."

 USA_Road_Goes_Both_Ways_desc: "Our tariff rates are among the highest in the world, and our protectionist policies are sure to be having an effect on not only the global recovery from the Great Depression but our own as well. To counteract this, we must make a complete reversal and sign into law the Reciprocal Tariff Act. This bill will not only begin to liberalize our trade policy but will allow the President himself to negotiate with foreign nations to reduce their tariffs in return for a reduction of our tariffs. This will usher in a new age of trade and should play a part in stimulating the global recovery from this economic crisis that we find ourselves in."

 USA_Regulate_Securities_Exchange_desc: "While the Federal Securities act has been largely successful in promoting ethical practices, its main jurisdiction is in the ”primary” market, i.e. it tailors only to the exchange between the company and the investor, leaving the ”secondary” market, which involves third parties, free to continue to employ exploitative practices. In pursuant to the government’s objective to promote a free and fair market, where individuals always have full ”disclosure” about the companies they intend to invest in, the Federal government will be enacting the Federal Securities Exchange Act. This act will finally allow the practice of ”disclosures” to be extended to the secondary market."

 USA_The_Second_New_Deal_desc: "President Roosevelt’s New Deal has so far been an unmitigated success, as the most pressing issues are being dealt with, relief is being sent out to the people who need it the most, and unemployment is beginning to fall slowly. The president’s work, however, is far from over. Until the end of his term, he will attempt to enact the second stage of his plans, a ”Second New Deal”. The bills and policies that Roosevelt intends to pass will tackle issues that are rooted deep in society and will create a strong foundation to build upon in the future. He will have to remain politically astute, however, as his political capital is not unlimited, and if he drops the ball, he could open himself up to a challenge from the Republican’s in the next election."

 USA_Expand_Youth_Program: "Expand the Youth Programs"
 USA_Expand_Youth_Program_desc: "As the Great Depression has continued to grip the American economy, unemployment and poverty have spiraled to record highs. These debilitating years have seen youth unemployment rise to 30% as the younger cohorts of the United States increasingly face the devastation of not being able to afford education. The New Deal needs to focus on the youth of our generation as well, or we may very well lose an entire generation if no action is taken. By Executive Order 7086, a new federal agency will be formed, the National Youth Administration, which will provide grants to youth in exchange for part-time work positions in various sectors of the education system along with vocational programs and occupational placements in a wide variety of fields, including recreation, public service, education, the arts, research and development, agriculture, and construction. The youth are the future of the nation, and under the guidance of the National Youth Administration, they will ensure a bright future for America."

The current administration as part of the New Deal, has heavily revised Senator Black’s initial draft to pass the Fair Labor Standards Act. The revised proposal will allow for an eight-hour day and a forty-hour work week, and workers will earn wages for an extra four hours of overtime. Along with this, a minimum wage will be established, and overtime pay must be one-and-a-half times regular pay. Children under eighteen will be denied from working in dangerous conditions, and children under sixteen cannot work in the manufacturing or mining industries or during school hours. This act has received a great deal of support from the President himself, meaning that it will pass without issue."

A large majority of our elderly population is drowning in poverty and the unemployed are living on the streets. This image of apathy is not something we want to project to the world, and certainly not to our own people, so something has to change. There recently has been a call for direct payments by the government to those who need them, providing the momentum that we need to erect a major pillar in the social welfare foundation that we are trying to construct."

 USA_Relieve_Puerto_Rico_desc: "Puerto Rico since its incorporation into the country has always been neglected. Its economy is heavily tied and dependent on the mainland through a series of economic arrangements that heavily favor US companies who hold monopoly over the whole cash crops sector. Even before the Great Depression, negative developments on the island and world economies perpetuated an unsustainable cycle of subsistence for many Puerto Rican workers. Generally, the living standards are very low and dangerous working and living conditions cause high mortality rates due to workplace accidents and diseases such as dysentery, diarrhea, malaria, and tuberculosis. To develop and fix the sorry state of affairs on the island, the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration has been created, falling under the authority of the Department of the Interior and the Farm Security Administration. Its primary goals will be to establish long term economic stability in Puerto Rico through job creation, land distribution, public works projects, as well as environmental and health initiatives. The task of developing Puerto Rico may be an arduous one, but one that is necessary and critical for national development."

However, in recent times the price of oil has fallen dramatically, causing some serious damage to the petroleum industry. The Connally Hot Oil Act, named after Senator Tom Connally, will be enacted to protect the industry from "contraband oil," cartelizing the industry to stabilize the falling prices of oil. Along with this objective, it will also grant the President authority to prohibit the transportation of petroleum that is produced or withdrawn from storage in excess of the amount permitted by the necessary Federal authorities. Though this act may be viewed as excessive, it is a necessary step to safeguard America’s Petroleum industry."

Right now the nation is mired by an unprecedented economic crisis, the likes of which the world has never seen before, millions are unemployed, many are starving everyday, but the ”Big Companies” in their lofty offices in Chicago, New York and the other metropolitan areas continue to wean off the poor, they hoard, they withhold salary checks, lay off workers without any due warning. They have become the dark side of the ”Opportunities” of America, exploiting the populace in midst of the hardships they face, the Companies need to be reminded of their duty to the nation which has supported them.

However, while the ”High” society still has many of its comforts, the middle and lower echelons have been pushed to the brink of destitution and desolation. The Revenue Act aims to soak the rich, penalize bigness, and help balance the budget by raising federal income tax on higher income levels. By introducing the "Wealth Tax”, incomes over $1 million per year will be liable to pay. There is strong opposition from businesses, the rich, and conservatives from both parties about such a measure, but America needs to recover, and to recover it needs every section of the Society to do its part, sacrifices must be made."

Long thought to be economically infeasible, the nation’s farm homes are not part of any major electrical grids, but usage of a 7200 volt distribution network can make transmission much easier in the long distances involved in the countryside. The President and the Congress will be signing the Executive Order 7037 which would create the Rural Electrification Administration.

Thousands of stricken and affected families are in need of immediate help, Rexford Tugwell an advisor to the President has been tasked with heading the Resettlement Administration. Among its duties, its primary goal would be to relocate the struggling urban and rural families.

 USA_an_Act_of_Neutrality_desc: "The long standing view and the conviction of many Americans is that the U.S. entry into the Great War had been orchestrated by bankers and the arms industry for profit reasons, this and other factors have strengthened the position of isolationists and non-interventionists considerably in the government. While the President himself is opposed to neutral policies, believing that they would restrict America's ability to help friendly nations, and even though he can technically veto to prevent such a policy from coming into effect, right now the domestic issues are so far flung that the President cannot afford to lose any of the Congressional support, lest he be unable to fully implement all of the New Deal legislations and the reforms he intends to carry out in the country. Due to his own reasons regarding the political front and the general populace’s support for isolationism, the president will be signing the Neutrality act, which effectively officiates America’s isolationist and non-interventionist stance."

Thousands have died in the last few years, while Americans have been sitting with their hands bound, long has such sordid state of affairs gone and on with no end in sight. The President has ordered the government to prepare the nation to protect itself from any and all manners of aggression, aid will be extended to friends of America who have long waged war against evil and the unjust.

 USA_Prevent_Another_Bonus_Army_desc: "The Bonus Army was a group of demonstrators – made up of 17,000 veterans, together with their families and affiliated groups - who gathered in Washington, D.C. in mid-1932 to demand early cash redemption of their service certificates which could not be redeemed until 1948, the media referred to them as the \"Bonus Army\" or \"Bonus Marchers\". Many of the war veterans had been out of work since the beginning of the Great Depression. Eventually on orders of the then-President Herbert Hoover the demonstration was driven out by General MacArthur. As the Great Depression has continued, there is every possibility that such an incident will happen again, despite the President’s protests the Congress has decided to pass the Adjusted Compensation Payment Act to compensate the veterans early. Veterans will be issued with US Treasury Bonds as a form of economic stimulus and relief, as it is estimated that many bonds will be cashed in promptly and constitute an efficient economic stimulus since little government administration is needed, the monies will likely be spent without delay, and the entire process does not require the long lead time of a public works program."

With our country’s entry in the Great War, the Selective Service Act of 1917 was enacted to expand the Army through conscription. The Subsequent end of the conflict led to the decrease in strength of the Army. Today dark clouds loom all over Europe and in Asia. Instability and tensions threaten Europe, while Japan’s sun is rising all over the Pacific, in all cases despite our neutrality, involuntarily we may be well pulled into a conflict the likes of which the world has never seen. The US Army historically has never been a particularly strong one, the British have the Battle of Waterloo, the Germans the Battle or Sedan, and the French the Battle of Austerlitz, the US Army’s limited experience include fighting its own countrymen, a few embarrassing battles in Mexico, and a few battles near the end of the Great War.

After the Militia Act of 1903, the state militias were organized into the National Guard, which assumed the roles and duties of the state militias. Today despite repeated American declarations of neutrality and despite our attempts to promote and foster peace, it seems that our country would most likely be involuntarily drawn into a conflict.

With tensions rising in Europe and across the world, we need to ensure that it is modernized and fully prepared for combat as soon as possible. The first step is to evaluate the current quality and readiness of our troops, officers and logistics, which we shall do by scheduling large-scale war games in the wide, open territories of Louisiana.

The general is also a strong leader, recognizing the need to delegate in order to keep his eyes on the big picture.

Currently, our field command structures are cumbersome, bloated and carry a lot of dead weight, hamstringing them and preventing quick, decisive actions from being made. This makes the units far less effective in the heat of battle, and leaves them vulnerable to surprise counter-attacks and other unforeseen enemy movements due to the lengthy communication channel between various levels of field command.

With our army currently in the phase of reformation and modernization, now would be the perfect time to adopt a fresh doctrine that could potentially throw our enemies off-balance.

Patton has been developing his theory of battle over his whole life, starting in the Great War.\n\nPatton has further developed his ideas with an experimental unit in Hawaii, and his ideas have shown merit in the recent Louisiana Maneuvers.

Their usage is varied and flexible, they can be employed for seizing key points such as bridges to speed up the advance of the traditional ground forces, or for risky yet rewarding maneuvers to create ”vertical envelopments”, i.e. to cut off retreating paths of the enemy formations to encircle and destroy them, with the paratroopers acting as the anvil and the ground armies hammering to destroy the enemy army.

These men often provide the example of General John J. Pershing’s costly frontal assaults during the Great War, which caused massive casualties to further their case. These theorists stray away from the conventional school of thinking and propose that tanks and other armored vehicles are the way to win the wars that are sure to come. Whatever may be the case, the infantryman is supposed to be slow, while our cavalry is supposed to move fast and strike hard. However, this is not necessarily the case. The current cavalry fielded by the US Army is cumbersome, slow and often extremely vulnerable, and it is obvious that the rules of warfare have changed. Whether they may be used for infiltration tactics or in conjunction with armor, the first step to evolve our Army into a modern, capable of force would be to equip them with motorized transport along with the likes of light armored vehicles such as scout cars which will sufficiently answer the long drawn question of how to provide troops with mobility along with adequate protection."

 USA_Sherman_Tank_desc: "Working upon its predecessor - the M3 medium tank, which was supposed to be a stopgap measure, the US Army Ordnance Department has come up with the design of the M4 ”Sherman” Medium Tank. Working upon past domestic lessons, while inculcating some through the British and Canadian inputs, the M4 Sherman has been designed to be cheap, reliable and of adequate quality, the Tank is supposed to be highly reliable owing to the utilization of a vertical volute spring suspension, rubber-bushed tracks, and a rear-mounted radial engine with drive sprockets in front and light enough to be easily loaded onto cargo ships and trains for quick transportation overland and overseas. Its chassis is also versatile and can be adopted for a host of other roles, which all add to the value of this particular armored vehicle."

This is an unacceptable possibility. In order to keep the army as strong as possible and keep our great nation as safe as possible, we must stay ahead of the curve and relentlessly continue improving upon the equipment and tools currently provided. This may be a simple equation, but it’s true nevertheless: Better equipment yields better results."

 USA_Broad_Front: "The Broad Front"
 USA_Broad_Front_desc: "General Eisenhower's rise has been a long and difficult one, starting the thirties as commander of a small unit in Washington State his military theory now determines most War Department policy. Put simply Eisenhowers policy would allow all field armies to better communicate and coordinate their actions to move forward in any given theater. This would allow our armies to be able to slowly but surely push back the enemy in a sort of slow methodical wave. Although counterintuitive The Broad Front would help to save lives and material and ensure that no US Army should be destroyed in detail. Only a few more techniques are needed to truly perfect this strategy for us."

 USA_Instill_Fear_Into_Enemy_Pilots_desc: "We will not always have friendly faces in the skies. That is just the reality of war. The effects of enemy aerial superiority have proven to be devastating on ground troops, and if we are to prevent our armies from making the mistakes as other armies, being decimated from the skies, we must make some serious investments into developing effective anti-air technology. These strides forward will make our armies capable of defending themselves from attack from the air and will make those enemy pilots think twice about flying towards their potential demise."

 USA_Improve_Gun_Motor_Carriages_desc: "With the Army's efforts to upgrade its fire power capacity the Brass have sent down the order to start development of upgraded motor gun carriages. A relatively new concept in the world of warfare, Motor Gun Carriages are heavy artillery on treads, a cheap and relatively easy way to get heavy artillery fire closer to the battlefield with less risk and more maneuverability. Usually made from the hull of a tank these vehicles will help make our new doctrine pay the most dividends in combat."

 USA_Shock_and_Awe: "Shock and Awe"
 USA_Shock_and_Awe_desc: "Many of our Generals who served during the Great War learned hard lessons about the nature of modern war. For George C. Marshall, it was the primacy and tactical power of Artillery and aerial bombardment. Through the interwar years Marshall has had the chance to study and test many of his ideas. Now with the position of Army Chief of Staff he can make the final reforms necessary to make his doctrine the prevailing one throughout the entire Army. The United States industrial power has made Marshall's plans a reality, with overwhelming artillery and other supporting attacks the US Army should be able to simply blast its way through any enemy lines."

We must use these things to our advantage, take risks, be aggressive on the battlefield and relentlessly push back the enemy, regardless of the conditions. This may be reckless to some, but if you don’t march forward and stay on the front foot, you won’t get closer to the enemy’s capital, and if you don’t take risks, you won’t win a war."

To ensure American dominance on the battlefield in these times, we must stay ahead of the curve technologically by constantly creating new and innovative ideas. However, we shouldn’t work alone. It would be prudent to work together with another democratic nation on this endeavor, as not only will the process be quicker, we can pool together our expertise and create a high-quality tank that will benefit both parties."

While he has his fair share of detractors, his theory of continuously and relentlessly attacking the enemy offers a large number of merits suitable to America’s strengths. He advocates the usage of large bodies of armored vehicles as leading a furious and relentless charge against the enemy to prevent him from regrouping and organizing a defense to the point where he’s so exhausted that he cannot offer any significant resistance and our troops can simply brush him aside."

From the construction of makeshift bridges at important crossings, to sabotage behind enemy lines, engineers provide a wide variety of military applications. Due to our isolation from the European Theater, it may become necessary for engineers to assist in naval assaults. If we want to be able to fight a war in Europe or the Pacific, we need to expand their capabilities, and provide them with a closer integration with their division."

 USA_M47_Patton: "The M47 Patton"
 USA_M47_Patton_desc: "Field usage of the current generation of Heavy Tanks has proven their capabilities to be seriously lacking, the M26 Pershing has seen to be having insufficient mobility and being very unreliable. Working upon our past lessons and addressing the immediate need of a sufficiently armored and gunned tank of the heavy category while boasting the mobility of lighter tanks; knowing the M46 was a stopgap solution and the T42 will not be possibly ready for field deployments anytime soon with officers of the Armored Force having serious misgivings about its projected performance, the M47 Patton Tank has been proposed. The M47, named in honor of our country’s foremost proponent of tank warfare, boasts the turret of the T42 mounted on the existing M46 hull, while some are voicing concerns over the M47 being another stopgap solution, army officials feel the improvements over the M46 in firepower and armor are worth the risk. Already the Detroit Arsenal has designated a production line for the production M47, as soon as the final research work and field trials are completed."

Sixteen battleships, all dressed in red, white and blue banners, traversed the globe on a journey to promote peace, prosperity and most of all, power. The stark painted-white hulls left an impression upon the globe that the United States could and would project her might wherever it need be. \n\nWith those original ships now themselves obsolete in most naval theatres, it is time to regain our prestige upon the seven seas. Battleships will be prioritized, with new investments in screen ships to add a layer of protection. Old hulls will be refitted and expanded, new hulls will be manned and gunned to the fullest.

Fortunately, we found a way to work around that. With the war in Spain raging on, the recent Neutrality Act proposed by the Republicans forbids the sale of weapons and the transport of U.S citizens to countries in conflict. But thanks to a provision we added, we are allowed to transport raw materials and supplies to the belligerent nations on Europe.

 USA_Reorganize_Executive_desc: "There hasn’t been a major planned reorganization of the executive branch since it’s creation in 1787, nearly 150 years ago. However, the modern presidency and the United States as it exists today, must be able to adapt to change quickly. The Reorganization Act of 1939 will do this, granting the President the authority to hire additional confidential staff while allowing reorganizations of the government’s branch’s staff. While some say this will limit the influence of the Cabinet and cast a shadow on executive privilege, the Act does come with certain limits and all adjustments are subject to legislative vetoes. This should allow the president more breathing room and governmental evolution in terms of policy"

 USA_Executive_Office_President: "The Executive Office of the President"
 USA_Executive_Office_President_desc: "The President of the United States needs help. He is like any other mortal man and needs the proper support structure in place if he is to govern effectively. In the past, president’s were hamstrung by this lack of support, and their administrations could never fulfil their potential. This must change immediately if President Roosevelt's administration and any future ones are to succeed. By establishing the Executive Office of the President, order will be brought to the White House, and the necessary foundation for any great government will be put in place."

 USA_Federal_Security_Agency: "Federal Security Agency"
 USA_Federal_Security_Agency_desc: "President Franklin D. Roosevelt has signed in the "Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1939", under the authority of the Reorganization Act of 1939. The reorganization plan is designed to reduce the number of agencies reporting directly to the president, by clubbing several smaller organizations directly under a single management, that can better assess the resources and ensure a more judicious of resources. The reorganization plan will create the Federal Security Agency, included in the FSA will be the Social Security Board, the U.S. Public Health Service, the Food and Drug Administration, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Office of Education, the National Youth Administration and a number of several other smaller agencies."

 USA_Expand_the_RFC: "Expand the RFC"
 USA_Expand_the_RFC_desc: "In 1932 Eugene Meyer, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors suggested the formation of an organization modelled on the lines of US War Finance Corporation of the Great War, the suggestion was accepted and recommended by the then President Herbert Hoover. The organization formed was the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, a government corporation administered by the United States Federal Government, its stated purpose is to provide financial support to state and local governments and made loans to banks, railroads, mortgage associations, and other businesses. Among the sweeping reforms, President Roosevelt is carrying out as part of ”The New Deal”, he has issued a directive to reassert the RFC by expanding it, its scope will be expanded and will include helping in economic recovery by taking proactive measures to boost the country’s confidence and help the banks, many which are struggling resume daily functions."

 USA_Federal_Works_Agency: "Federal Works Agency"
 USA_Federal_Works_Agency_desc: "As part of the first ever planned reorganization of the executive branch of the government of the United States since 1787, various Federal agencies and institutions are being clubbed into fewer but larger ”catch all” agencies, pursuant to the recently enacted reorganization plans authorized by the Reorganization Act. The Federal Works Agency (FWA) will act as an independent agency of the federal government of the United States, administering a number of public construction works, building maintenance, and public works relief functions and laws. At the present due to the economic conditions in the country, its mission will be expanded, it will construct public works, such as parks, water treatment systems, roads, and buildings, employ the unemployed to construct such works, and to issue loans and grants to regional authorities, states, counties, and localities for the construction of public works on the lines of providing fair work to the citizens of America."

 USA_End_the_Arms_Embargo: "End the Arms Embargo"
 USA_End_the_Arms_Embargo_desc: "Clouds of war loom all over Europe, it won't matter who is responsible for firing the first shot, the continent seems to be at the dawn of another conflict. But this time the stakes are too high, extremist movements have sprouted and matured all over Europe and seem to be motivated to destroy and uproot the democratic way of life, wherever it still stands. The United States has the global responsibility of preserving peace and democracy, and must help the democracies of Europe in their fight against extremism, while our domestic policies may prevent the President to directly intervene in the war, vital material aid should be made available to all the countries, be it in Europe or Asia in their fight against the extremist aggressors."

 USA_Food_Stamp_Plan: "Food Stamp Plan"
 USA_Food_Stamp_Plan_desc: "With the British appeal for more aid and supplies, and an ever increasing probability that our peace loving country would be pulled unwillingly into the global conflict, currently raging across Europe and Asia, critical resources need to be conserved. Any day our factories may be ordered to switch over production from tractors to tanks, a war industry requires several materials that are taken for granted during times of peace. The Federal government has issued necessary directives to the suitable authorities to begin planning for a massive Food Stamp System to be implemented across the country, for the preservation of food stocks and other necessary resources."

 ### 1936 - Landon
 USA_Landon_Boom: "The Landon Boom"

 USA_Fair_Compromise: "A Fair Compromise"
 USA_Fair_Compromise_desc: "The New Deal proved itself to be rather effective during the former President's tenure, especially at relieving some of the economic pain for those who were out of work. However, despite its relative success, the time has come to replace it with something that will work for not just the underprivileged, but also for the enterprising businessmen of the future.\n\nOf course, we don't intend to completely tear apart all the government programs and legislation that was drafted over the past four years, since the Depression continues to leave its mark on the nation, but the initial emergency has passed.\n\nWe must now look to strike a fair compromise across a wider area of the political spectrum, and cut down on the considerable waste and inefficiency of certain facets of the New Deal, crafting a more business-friendly approach in order to allow for the endeavours of the American people to bring us out of this crisis stronger than ever."
