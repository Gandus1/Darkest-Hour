## Nuclear Attacks on Japan
##############################################  
 Nuke_JAP.1.t: "Atomic Bombing of Nagasaki"
 Nuke_JAP.1.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The port city of Nagasaki has experienced air raids before, but none like what has happened at [GetDateText], for this was no ordinary enemy bombing run. High in the sky, a [ROOT.GetAdjective] bomber flew over the city, along with two other planes, while citizens were confused about why three would attack Nagasaki. Their questions were answered with a deadly and catastrophic response: 25 kilotons of atomic energy.\n\nWhat followed was chaos, destruction, and inhumane suffering.\n\nThe city was known for the Mitsubishi Steel Works and Arms Works, helping to produce material for the Japanese war effort; these were annihilated in a blink of an eye, along with most of the city and the port. Thousands of people who intended to go about their daily lives were wiped out before they had a chance to react. Innocent people caught in the middle of war and conflict have been added to the depressingly long list of casualties that never seems to stop growing. Yet this is different. A weapon of this magnitude will surely mean that Nagasaki will be written about in history books for many decades to come, although for all the wrong reasons.\n\nHigh levels of radiation have been reported from the area, with people being advised to stay away. With the Japanese knowing that the [ROOT.GetAdjective]s have a powerful weapon like this in their arsenal, will they be willing to lay down their arms? It certainly seems that way as the war situation is not developing to their advantage…"

 Nuke_JAP.2.t: "Atomic Bombing of Hiroshima"
 Nuke_JAP.2.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Fire. Ash. Hell. That is what the people will read about not only today but forever more in history. At [GetDateText], [ROOT.GetName] dropped what can be described as the most powerful weapon the world has seen; an atomic bomb.\n\nIts target: Hiroshima.\n\nThe deadly weapon was dropped from one [ROOT.GetAdjective] bomber accompanied by an instrumentation plane and a photography plane, all barely noticed as many citizens most likely thought they were returning to a nearby base. Falling for nearly 45 seconds, the bomb exploded just above the ground with an almighty explosion and a blinding flash of light. Then the devastation began. Four square miles of the city centre were obliterated in seconds, with much of the remaining area left in complete ruins. Schools full of children, restaurants, shops, and cafes all bustling with people going about their daily lives were erased without any mercy; estimates are still fuzzy, but some say that 90,000 have been killed instantly.\n\nFor those who have barely survived, what will they find? Ruined streets, dead friends and family, a world turned upside down. And for the rest of Japan, what comes next? Will [JAP.GetLeader] rouse the nation to fight on until the bitter end, as it is the warrior tradition? If so, what will it take for their leaders to finally see that the war may be slipping from their hands? While many questions are being asked, only one has been answered:\n\nThe Atomic Age has arrived, for better or for worse."

 Nuke_JAP.3.t: "Atomic Bombing of Tokyo"
 Nuke_JAP.3.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Tokyo is an ancient city, having been the imperial capital since 1868 after the end of the shogunate. Having been damaged heavily by the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923, it was quickly rebuilt, only to be hit again by enemy bombers during the war. Now, it has been hit by a bomber, a [ROOT.GetAdjective] bomber to be specific, dropping a single device that has caused unfathomable destruction.\n\nLarge parts of the city had been made of wood, which was decimated by the sheer power of the blast. Other buildings, such as those that had been built to withstand earthquakes also stood no chance, much like those within them. While the population had been much lower than that at the start of the war, millions still lived within the ancient city, meaning millions have either been killed or wounded, with observers saying that it is too early to try to estimate casualties. \n\nSomething of great concern to the Japanese people is the welfare of their Emperor. The Imperial Palace was levelled during the detonation, with anyone inside unlikely to survive. Luckily, he had been on an outing to Osaka to meet with those affected by the bombing raid there. Some reports say he is heading back to the Tokyo area, although he will be unable to go near because of the extensive damage.\n\nThe Japanese are not known for surrendering with ease, but the destruction of their capital might make them think twice about continuing to fight an enemy that now has a much more superior advantage."

Although taking the brunt of the explosion, the bomb toppled only seven of the colourful domes on top of Saint Basil's Cathedral and burned the other three to a black crisp. The Spasskaya Tower was split into two halves, with the top half of the clock tower flying a few inches before crashing into the square. The Kremlin fortress was flattened, as well as the thousands of homes and buildings surrounding ground zero.\n\nThe death toll is currently unknown, as rescue workers are focusing on saving as many lives as possible, and putting out a raging fire that's spreading into the suburbs of the city. However, it's expected to be in the tens of millions. The cites leaders and officials have been reported to be safe and in an undisclosed location."

## Nuclear Attacks on Germany

 Nuke_GER.1.t: "Atomic Obliteration of Berlin"
 Nuke_GER.1.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The German people looked to the skies today, not to see clouds or bombers flying over like they usually would, but to see a light brighter than the sun and a giant plume of smoke and ash rising in the shape of a mushroom, over the German capital.\n\nThe [ROOT.GetName]'s greatest modern weapon, the atomic bomb, has found its way to Berlin.\n\nThe bomb dropped just 300 yards from Brandenburg Gate, destroying the 18th-century monument in one blast like it was made of cardboard. The Reichstag building, a symbol of democracy, wasn't too lucky either, as the shock wave demolished most of the already fire-damaged building. The many market squares and bustling streets, such as the Gendarmenmarkt, became hellish chaos. The few people that survived the initial blast tried to escape, but the rain of fire and toxic ash from atomic fallout was a finishing blow for many poor civilians. Eyewitnesses on the outskirts of Berlin report thousands of windows have been shattered, and a black cloud has fallen over the city from the fires consuming it. Out of sheer luck, the government and military officials present in Berlin had been either underground or outside the city, before the bomb detonated.\n\nEmergency services from the area were quick to help as many people as possible, but the rubble and wreckage from collapsed buildings have made it increasingly difficult to reach the inner city by vehicle. This will only add to the estimated death toll of one and a half million."

 Nuke_GER.2.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Essen, a long time industrial powerhouse and the second-largest city in the Ruhr, faced its darkest hour, as an atomic bomb detonated directly over the market district.\n\nLittle is known on why the [ROOT.GetName] dropped one of their most powerful weapons on Essen, as there were larger cities in the Rhineland and better industrial targets to take advantage of, but nevertheless, the German city ended up in chaos. The many coal and mining facilities throughout Essen have been either blown apart or caught in a burning blaze, further adding to the massive fire that's engulfing the town. Locals nicknamed the fire “Feuer aus Eisen,” or “Fires of Iron,” due to its destruction of multiple mining districts. The landmark Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex suffered severe damage to its shafts and elevators as well, due to the intense shockwave after the detonation. But, from what seemed like the grace of God, the iconic Shaft 12 stood strong.\n\nEssen’s Emergency Services have had little trouble accessing the city, and are currently trying to evacuate the citizens present. The current death estimate is unknown, but it's thought to be lower than 150k."

## Nuclear Attacks on Italy

 Nuke_ITA.1.t: "Atomic Bombing of Rome"
 Nuke_ITA.1.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The Eternal City showed that its days could be numbered, as the [ROOT.GetName] dropped the deadliest weapon known to man on Rome.\n\nAn atomic bomb fell from a [ROOT.GetAdjective] bomber, and exploded over the Colosseum. The two thousand-year-old structure was obliterated in an instant, as well as everything around it. Soon after, the weapon spawned a shockwave so powerful that it shattered the Pantheon's pillars, as it continued to flattened homes and businesses that existed in the city for hundreds of years in a mile radius. Even though the explosion's position was aimed away from the Vatican, a smaller shockwave shattered many windows across the holy state. A large mushroom cloud then sprang up over the city, raining down fire and toxic ash on the ancient metropolis like Pompeii suffered in 79 A.D.\n\nFire and Rescue Services in Rome filled the burning streets to put out the catastrophic fires that were trapping many victims, only to find their main water source, the Tiber River, had mostly evaporated due to the bomb's extreme heat. Only time can tell if the Caput Mundi will survive this deadly strike.\n\nThe Pope, who was in the northern part of the Italian Peninsula at the time of the attack, was quick to condemn the use of such a weapon, calling it “An act of which only the Devil himself could think of.”"

 Nuke_ITA.2.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]At one moment, the Queen of the Adriatic was still one of the most beautiful and enchanting cities in Europe.\n\nThen in another, it became a one-way ticket to a radioactive nightmare.The [ROOT.GetAdjective] nuclear program has shown its true might, as a bomber dropped an atomic bomb on the Italian city of Venice. The weapon’s fireball vaporized the centre of the town, destroying the ancient architecture that stood for thousands of years. The ancient canals, however, were a different story. Because of the relative newness of the atomic bomb, not even the [ROOT.GetName] would have known how it would affect water, but Venice spectacularly showed us what the bomb could do. The shockwave not only flattened thousands of buildings but caused the canals to turn the rivers into small tidal waves, drowning many who thought of escaping on water. \n\nMultiple historical landmarks have been either destroyed or severely damaged as well. Witnesses say St Mark's Campanile, the iconic bell tower, was completely knocked off its foundation, and its bell rang a final ding as it plummeted into the canal. The Venetian Arsenal, a storage facility of former shipyards and armouries, was reduced to ruins. It could take years to bring Venice back to its original state, but the thousands of years of historical construction will never truly be rebuilt.\n\nThe Ponte Della Liberta, one of the only access points to Venice by road, was partially destroyed by the shock wave, and [FROM.GetAdjective] rescue teams have reportedly had to sit and watch The Floating City burn and sink on the coast of Mestre until more boating equipment arrived."

 Nuke_FRA.1.t: "Atomic Bombing of Paris"
 Nuke_FRA.1.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Revolutions, wars, and disasters have plagued Paris from the day it was settled in 259 BC by Celtic tribes, but the cultural capital of the world never truly fell. Today, however, the city of love was violently shaken to its core, and may never truly recover.\n\nA [ROOT.GetAdjective] atomic bomb fell from a high altitude bomber and landed near the Tuileries Garden. In just a second, the fireball consumed the garden and sent off a shock wave that obliterated hundreds of priceless businesses and homes. The resulting mushroom cloud sent rains of ash and fire across the city, igniting multiple fires in places not even close to ground zero. The Bois De Boulogne, the second-largest park in Paris, was set ablaze by the fallout, resulting in an even larger cloud of smoke as the mushroom cloud faded.\n\nThe countless landmarks all over Paris couldn't be saved this time by their uniqueness. The Louvre was the first to go, as the blast damage and heat from the fireball brought the glass museum, and the unparalleled amount of historical artwork, to burning embers. Most of Notre-Dame de Paris was levelled by the shock wave, but anything that was left of it went up in flames. The Eiffel Tower, the very heart and soul of Paris, was lucky enough to be out of the high-pressure range. When some of the smoke cleared, citizens could still look up and see it standing. A blackened, severely damaged, symbol of hope, still standing. "

 Nuke_ENG.1.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Being separated from Europe by the English Channel, a limited sense of security has always been in the minds of Londoners. Today, that feeling was utterly shattered.\n\n[ROOT.GetName] dropped the deadliest weapon known to man, the atomic bomb, near the South Bank in London. As the bomb exploded above Queen's Walk, the deadly shock wave blasted throughout the city. Multiple historical districts, full of families homes and businesses, were flattened like pancakes. The King's College campus, housing hundreds of students at the time, became nothing short of tinder wood. Many students attending college are now considered dead, while some are still considered missing. The London Underground subway system, which was acting as bombing shelters, caved in multiple areas. The casualties caused by this are still unknown. \n\nLondon's jewels were hardly given mercy in the explosion. Big Ben chimed for the last time, as the House of Commons and Buckingham Palace suffered complete collapse under the shock wave's pressure. Luckily, the house was in recess at the time of the bombing, but the whereabouts of the royalty and many officials is still unknown. The Tower Bridge wasn’t safe either, as the same shock wave broke the hydraulically powered bascule bridge into two, plummeting both halves into the river below. Now, as London burns with fallout raining around it, the future of the [FROM.GetName] is truly thrown into uncertainty."

 Nuke_TUR.1.t: "Atomic Bombing of Istanbul"
 Nuke_TUR.1.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Istanbul, formerly known as Byzantion, New Rome and Constantinople, a city with more history than the country itself, has been reduced to nothing but rubble and ashes in mere minutes. On this fateful day, the city has been hit by an Atomic Bomb dropped from a bomber sent by the [ROOT.GetAdjective] government, in order to boost their war effort against Turkey. With an approximate population of 800.000, civilian casualties are expected to be high.\n\nFormer capital of the Roman Empire, the eastern Roman Empire, the Latin Empire, the Byzantine Empire and the Ottoman Empire, Istanbul had been of great importance and played an important role in history for many centuries. In 1923, after the Turkish War of Independence, Ankara replaced the city as the capital of the newly formed Republic of Turkey, yet Istanbul was still of great symbolic and economic importance to Turkey and its loss will surely cause great damage to the morale of the Turkish forces and government, as well as their economy.\n\nOn this day, the world has lost a place of great historical and cultural value that we may never be able to recover."

 Nuke_GRE.1.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Athens, the birthplace of democracy, finds itself at the crossroads of history once again. The ancient city and her many monuments had largely been spared any major destructions of the war, yet only to be annihilated, in a moment, by blinding atomic light and a raging inferno.\n\nA lone [ROOT.GetAdjective] bomber dropped its payload directly over the heart of the old city. The bomb, released at an altitude of 1,300 feet, let loose a blast that equated to 15 kilotons of TNT on the Greek capital. The loss of life is expected to be catastrophic as the height of the detonation allowed the explosion to avoid being hindered by the surrounding hills.\n\nThe Parthenon, the Acropolis, and the temples of Athena Nike, Hephaestus, and Olympian Zeus are flattened; the power of man surpassing even the power of gods. The famous Panathenaic Stadium remained mostly intact, but its white marble was scorched black in the ferocious heat of the blast. The National Archaeological Museum also received extensive damage.\n\nThe surrounding hills and mountains have complicated rescue efforts as the smoke from the fires and fallout from the blast hang low over the city with no sign of movement in the near future. The continued delay of these essential rescue crews will undoubtedly cause the death toll to rise even higher."

In an instant, a fireball engulfed and demolished the Imperial Palace, surrounding courtyards, walls, and temples. Even the famed Temple of Heaven was not spared this fate. The place where emperors from the Ming and Qing Dynasties would pray for good harvests was reduced to a pile of rubble. The fields that were their attention during these prayers are known fields of fire and death. One of the oldest cities of the world is now the newest to become a smoking scar on the face of the earth. The loss of cultural and historical artefacts is predicted by observers to reach an unprecedented level.\n\nRescue services continue to fight the blazing fires as they push deeper into the heart of the old Chinese capital, but there are expected to be few survivors among the debris.

The U.S Capitol building was the envy of the world and the pride of the United States, only to be instantly vaporised by the extreme heat, fire, and shockwaves that engulfed the entire city.\n\nFrom the [ROOT.GetName]’s latest technical innovation, a Bomber laden with a Nuclear Device approached the City along with the escort of a Fighter Squadron. American Interceptors had been sent to intercept the Bomber but met fierce fighting and resistance from the [ROOT.GetAdjective] fighter escort and were soon driven off. The efforts of the American pilots were in vain when the [ROOT.GetAdjective] bomber finally opened its bomb bay doors over the City.\n\nAnd that was when Hell broke loose, picturesque of Dante's Inferno.\n\nA huge fiery ball appeared, instantly vaporising those near the fireball. Detonating right above the Capitol, the effects of the Nuclear Explosion were soon evident. The Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and all of the Capital's heritage and vestige were destroyed in an instant- burnt, and vaporised in the nuclear explosion. The nerve centre of the American war-planning has not only collapsed but been surgically wiped by the atomic bomb. \n\nWashington D.C is a former, hollow shell of itself. After the fireball quickly subsided and a mushroom cloud had set in, the remaining survivors peaked out to the obscure grey sky and saw that rubble and flattened buildings were everywhere, covered by thick smoke topped with ash falling from the sky.\n\nThe President’s whereabouts are unknown, but it is feared that he has been killed in the nuclear blast while some believe that he was timely evacuated along with a significant portion of his staff.
