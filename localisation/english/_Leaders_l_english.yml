 # Afghanistan
 AFG_Mohammed_Zahir_desc: "Afghanistan is ruled by Mohammed Zahir Shah, King of Afghanistan, and his uncles, Mohammed Hashim Khan and Shah Mahmud Khan. He has presided over a prosperous reign of internationalism and economic expansion. While he is new to the throne, he is well-liked by the Afghan people."

 # Australia
 AST_John_Curtin_desc: "John Curtin has the ability to say he was all of these things in his life: a supporter of workers, a union advocate, a Labour MP in Parliament, and finally Prime Minister. This Western Australian politician has a lot to live up to after rising to prominence through the Labour Party in the 1920s and eventually taking over after James Scullin stepped down.\n\nThe Labour Party struggled after the loss of experienced politicians such as Joseph Lyons and James Fenton due to a leadership change. However, this was a learning experience for them. They were united and strong under Curtin's firm, guiding hand of leadership, with one common goal: rights for the working man and his family. Curtin, like the Labour Party as a whole, gained popularity by campaigning hard for the common man.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Labour Party has fought tooth and nail with the United Australia Party on issues such as the economy, tariffs, pensions, and trade. Curtin is a strong proponent of rearmament, citing Japan's ever-expanding empire as a threat. The UAP supports the Conservatives in London, with some Labor Party members quietly supporting them. Curtin will have to deal with the Australian people's unwillingness to go to war and prepare them for the impending global conflict now that he is in office.\n\nLeaders and political ideologies come and go over time. However, only a few Prime Ministers are recognised and thanked for their accomplishments. Whatever happens in the coming years, John Curtin will be one of those Prime Ministers."
 AST_Ben_Chifley_desc: "Many politicians are forced to make compromises on their  promises. A strong leader, on the other hand, deals in absolutes. He fights for what he believes in and refuses to give in to the other side until he has won. Many people call this obstinacy. Others describe it as strong-willed. It's safe to call Ben Chifley both.\n\nChifley, who has been a member of the Labor Party since the 1920s, is an unwavering supporter of the party's cause. Serving briefly as Defence Minister in the 1930s, he established himself as a close ally of John Curtin and bravely followed him to victory in 1941. He never let the stress of World War II get to him while serving. Unfortunately, Curtin did not live to see the war's end, and Chifley took his place as Prime Minister..\n\nFighting for the soldiers' immediate return, he is constantly at odds with the newly formed Liberal Party's leader, 'Pig Iron Bob,' the man who sold Australia's iron to the Japanese. The conflict between them is almost as heated as the one that existed prior to the war between Curtin and Lyons. Nonetheless, Chifley will continue to steer the country in the direction he sees fit, and in which many Australians agree.\n\nAs the Pacific War draws to a close, Chifley must quickly transition from wartime to peacetime as Prime Minister. His government will be defined by how he conducts himself in the aftermath of the greatest conflict in history. One thing is certain: the new peacetime political landscape will be drastically different, for better or worse.."

 # Brazil
 BRA_Getulio_Vargas_desc: "Getulio Vargas, President of the Republic of the United States of Brazil, continues to lead his country as their "president". His dictatorship, the "Estado Novo," or New State, appears to be on track to rule Brazil for an extended period of time. While Brazil remains within the United States' sphere of influence, Vargas' regime has taken a great deal of inspiration from the populist regimes that arose in Europe after World War I, and his country, under his guidance, could be dragged into the next great war."

 # Britain
 ENG_Ramsay_MacDonald_desc: "If there was a man, a politician, to represent British socialists, James Ramsay MacDonald would be an obvious choice.\n\nMacDonald was born on October 12, 1866, in Lossiemouth, Scotland, the illegitimate son of poor Scottish parents. He was born in the right place and at the right time to embrace Marxist ideals. At the tender age of nineteen, he joined the Social Democratic Federation, and later the Bristol Socialist Society, which would prove beneficial to his immediate and long-term political success in London.\n\n1900 and later becoming chairman of the party, which was termed as the Labour Party, in 1911. The British political scene, however, would never be the same after MacDonald won the position of Prime Minister in the 1923 election. MacDonald has remained active in politics ever since.\n\nMacDonald was only Prime Minister for a short and uneventful ten months before Stanley Baldwin reclaimed the position in November, 1924. In the meantime, however, support for the Labour Party grew, and MacDonald reclaimed the position of Prime Minister in 1931.\n\nRamsey MacDonald's leadership is under threat from the Tories, who are closing in on reclaiming control of Parliament."
 ENG_Stanley_Baldwin_desc: "A man born into a wealthy family will have an abundance of opportunities throughout his life. When it comes to Stanley Baldwin, there is little change from this statement.\n\nBaldwin was a fitting image for a man involved in politics, but he spent the majority of his life outside the halls of the House of Commons. He has industrial experience, and, like any good politician, he served in the army but never saw combat.\n\nBecause becoming an MP was not a high enough aim for him at his age, Baldwin quickly rose through the ranks of both government and party. Tragedy in the Tories created an opening for Baldwin, who became Prime Minister in 1923 and again in 1924. His tenure lasted until 1929, when the Labour Party won the elections and forced Baldwin into opposition.\n\nUnfortunately for his successor, Baldwin became Lord President of the Council and re-emerged as a candidate for Prime Minister. Baldwin accomplished this goal by clawing his way back to the top, and he now sees global turmoil developing. Worse are the domestic issues, primarily economic problems, throughout the United Kingdom and the rise of extremist factions on the Isles. Finally, the King's failing health threatens a royal succession, but Baldwin has little time to be concerned about this.\n\nWith King George on the verge of death, only time will tell how his son's accession will affect Baldwin's and Britain's path."
 ENG_Winston_Churchill_1935_desc: "The Dardanelles Campaign and the subsequent deaths of 250,000 men have haunted the people of the British Isles in the years since the Great War, serving as a reminder of the folly of war and the value of life. No one has been haunted by these memories more than the campaign's main sponsor, Winston Churchill. However, it appears that his nightmare is coming to an end, as he has been appointed Prime Minister, succeeding Ramsay MacDonald as the leader of the British government.\n\nChurchill, a popular and promising politician with a penchant for the unconventional, found himself in a political wilderness. He had a small chance to revitalise his career as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Stanley Baldwin's Conservative government, but after several mistakes that contributed to the country's current economic crisis and a Labour victory in the subsequent general election, that opportunity blew past him.\n\nNow considered damaged goods, he decided to devote himself to literature and speeches, thereby remaining politically relevant. During this time, he made it clear that he supported military rearmament and that he wanted the government to stand firm against any aggression. These were bold opinions that earned him much-needed support in Parliament.\n\nMany people were surprised by Churchill's appointment, despite his slightly improved political standing, but he has no time to waste. Churchill will need to act quickly to secure his precarious political position and usher in the slew of changes he has so vehemently advocated — a daunting task for someone with such a poor track record."
 ENG_Winston_Churchill_desc: "War. It has gripped the world once more, and the United Kingdom was unprepared. Because of their lack of preparation, they are now in a perilous position, with much of Europe already in the hands of fascism.\n\nThis was not necessary. The appeasement policy was a mistake because it only demonstrated weakness while doing nothing to satisfy the revisionist powers' appetite for land, and in the end, it didn't matter because war still arrived. To have a fighting chance, everyone must put in a massive effort to get every part of the country in shape. To kickstart this effort, a new leadership was needed, and it had to be someone who could inspire the British people and ingrain in them a never-say-die spirit.\n\nWinston Churchill provided that new leadership.\n\nChurchill was a war correspondent who wrote about his experiences while serving in the army as a young man. After that, he became a politician, serving in both Conservative and Liberal governments. Churchill was not popular among his fellow Tories prior to his appointment as Prime Minister due to his defiant nature, but public support and aggressive anti-German rhetoric propelled him into 10 Downing Street.\n\nAs Churchill assumes command, the fate of Britain and the world's democracies hangs in the balance. Will his unwavering determination and "bulldog" spirit be enough to stem the tide of fascism, or will it fall short, allowing the sun to finally set on the British Empire?"
 ENG_George_V_desc: "After his father died in 1910, George Frederick Ernest Albert, or George V, ascended the British throne as King of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, as well as Emperor of India.\n\nWithin his realm, he has witnessed the rise of the first mass mobilised widespread political movements: socialism, communism, fascism, Irish republicanism, and the Indian independence movement, but on the outside, he has also witnessed the fall of his first cousins Nicholas II of Russia and Wilhelm II of Germany's empires. He has presided over the empire his forefathers left him and guided the British Empire to its greatest effective extent, avoiding the unenviable fate of his relatives.\n\nWhile Europe slowly and steadily sinks into economic depressions and becomes a target for extremist movements, the British Monarch nears the end of his life, growing older and suffering from smoking-related health problems. The British economy and political landscape are in disarray as a result of the Great Depression and its aftermath, and the natives of the British colonies' call for independence grows stronger. The King must steel his resolve and guide his people through, if not for himself, then for the legacy of a now-wilting empire."
 ENG_George_VI_desc: "A sportsman, a pilot, a naval officer, and a business enthusiast, but never a king. George was born fourth in line to the throne, after his grandfather, father, and older brother, Edward, who was only a year older. This created the illusion that George would never be the heir to the British Crown, giving him far more time to devote to his future subjects than would otherwise be possible.\n\nThe new Duke of York's naval involvement allowed him to take part in the Battle of Jutland during World War I, and he was also the first member of the British Royal Family to qualify as a Royal Air Force pilot. However, after the war, George's primary concern shifted to British industrial welfare, and his frequent visits to factories earned him the moniker ‘Industrial Prince.’\n\nIn contrast to his much more glamorous and extroverted brother, Edward, the Duke of York completed his duties quietly and efficiently, despite having a stutter that caused him to dread public speaking.\n\nThe Monarchy had entered uncharted territory with Edward VIII's abdication, which came as a shock to George, who had little experience with politics. Many questioned the new King, seeing him as nothing more than an interloper to the ever-popular Edward VIII.\n\nInexperienced, unpopular, and with the Monarchy still reeling from the abdication crisis, how will George VI restore the British Empire's glory?"

 # Canada
 CAN_Mackenzie_King_desc: "Mackenzie King was a bright young man who earned five university degrees and became deeply concerned about social welfare issues in Canada. He was appointed to the position of Deputy Minister of Labour in 1900. During his tenure, he was elected to the Liberal Party's House of Commons. This success made King the first-ever Minister of Labour, but it all came crashing down when he lost his parliamentary seat two years later, prompting King to withdraw from politics.\n\nThe Liberal Party became fractured and divided over the issue of conscription as the Great War progressed, with many of its members defecting to the conservative coalition government. Following the war and the death of the Liberal Party's leader, King triumphantly returned to politics, filling the leadership void and making it his sole responsibility to reconcile the factions within the party and reunite the party, which he accomplished by leading the Liberals to victory in the 1921 elections.\n\nAs Prime Minister, he attempted to reduce ethnic tensions, deal with immigration, and increase the dominion's autonomy within the Commonwealth. However, King's Liberals were defeated in the 1930 elections, as the Great Depression loomed and the economy suffered.\n\nHowever, the conservative government failed to address the crisis, and King was re-elected prime minister after only one term. He now has a second chance at success, and if he is to bring prosperity to Canada, he must seize it with both hands."

 # Communist China
 PRC_Mao_Zedong_desc: "As the son of a prosperous peasant family, Mao draws his lineage and experiences from the strata of Chinese society that will prove to be the bedrock of his later endeavours.\n\nBorn during the final dying breath of a decaying empire, the times ahead for China and Mao would be difficult and bloody, but they would also be times of change, social upheaval, reform, and reconstruction. These were revolutionary times. Such were the exact thoughts of Mao Zedong as a young man as he read book after book. From his home fields to the libraries of Changsha, he immersed himself in ideologies and philosophical thought that most Chinese people could not comprehend.\n\nWhile brutes and strongmen ruled China and oppressed the lower classes, believing that their pervasive brutality would go unnoticed as in the past, a coalition of social dissenters and intellectuals banded together. Indeed, with the establishment of the Communist Party of China, the common man's tears of oppression and cries for liberation were given a face. Following the betrayal of the Kuomintang's cowardly nationalists, and with the establishment of the Red Army, it had also gained a body of which Mao was a maximal component.\n\nMao revealed himself to be not only an ideologue, but also a formidable tactician, thanks to the instrumental knowledge he gained from studying such great minds as Napoleon and Sun Tzu. A guerrilla-centric warfare style supported by discipline, peasant and bandit regimes, and topographic knowledge proved more than enough to halt the Nationalists' advances into the territories of the newly established Chinese Soviet Republic.\n\nMao has proven himself to be a dynamic statesman and a cutthroat commander through his tireless efforts to better the people and the revolution, propelling him to the top of the party's popularity and ranks. But difficult times lie ahead, and it remains to be seen whether he can lead the people to a new China."
 PRC_Bo_Gu_desc: "History is said to be a great teacher, and Bo Gu knows this. As one of the twenty-eight Bolsheviks inspired by the Soviet revolution, he knew that if he could replicate Moscow's efforts in China, the Chinese people would be liberated from the yolk of emperors who were only interested in securing their own power, rather than in the welfare of the people.\n\nOf course, that was only theoretical. Power politics do not end simply because one believes in revolution, and Bo Gu had to make strides toward victory. Of course, he won, but winning is not the same as maintaining. His CCP leadership is sloppy at best, with failures to capture cities from the KMT thugs, and cracks are appearing in his leadership. He must act now or risk being overtaken by more ambitious men."

 # France
 FRA_Edouard_Daladier_desc: "There will come a time in a man's life when he must make decisions that will make or break everything. The current French Prime Minister, Edouard Daladier, appears to be approaching a ‘make or break’ moment.\n\nDaladier was born on June 18th, 1884, in Vaucluse, the son of a village baker. He was educated at Lyon's Lycée Duparc, where he was first exposed to socialist politics. He joined the French Army as a sergeant at the start of the Great War. He fought in the Battle of Verdun in 1916, earning a field commission as a Lieutenant and multiple medals, including the Legion of Honor. His large stature and bravery in the face of danger earned him the moniker ‘Bull of Vaucluse.’\n\nHe became a leading member of the Radical-Socialist Party after entering the Chamber of Deputies as the representative for Vaucluse, leading it since 1920 and elevating it to the status of France's most notable left-wing party. The numerous attempts to form a broad republican-left front on which France could run finally paid off on December 18th, 1932, with the formation of the said coalition.\n\nHis rise, however, has not been without setbacks. The rise of the French Far Right and Far-Right leagues has been a thorn in his side, with their populist rhetoric attracting increasing support. If they gain significant power, they may be able to bring down the Republic as a whole, with the Army siding with these thuggish anti-republicans.\n\nDaladier stands as a bulwark of Republicanism in the face of rising reactionary fury. Will he stand firm, or will the Tricolore be ripped from its pole once more?"
 FRA_Joseph_Paul_Boncour_desc: ""
 FRA_Albert_Sarraut_desc: ""
 FRA_Leon_Blum_desc: "Leon Blum, a man who does not waver in the face of adversity and who stands firm for his true beliefs, has persevered through difficult times and led the socialists of France to greatness. Unlike many other modern leaders, Blum's youth was focused on law and literacy rather than politics.\n\nBlum had been deeply affected by the Dreyfus Affair, and it was his campaign as a Dreyfusard that brought him into contact with socialist leader Jean Jaurés, who inspired Blum to join the French Section of the Worker's International. Blum witnessed the appalling state of France's internal politics, where rival factions divided the country.\n\nThe assassination of Jaurés in 1914 shook the SFIO to its core, but the October Revolution further splintered the party. While Blum worked hard to unite both supporters and opponents of the Soviet Regime, an internal schism was already visible, leading to the party's split. The Leninists created French Communist Party, and the SFIC and the SFIO remained held together in the hands of Blum.\n\nAs a result of Hitler's rise to power increasing support for fascism, Stalin encouraged a coalition between the SFIC and the SFIO, forming the Popular Front. The Front won a landslide victory in an economically depressed France, but Blum's victory within a divided nation alienated many.\n\nCan Blum, now Prime Minister, successfully bring France's fractured people back together?"
 FRA_Pierre_Laval_desc: ""
 FRA_Pierre_Etienne_Flandin_desc: ""
 FRA_Albert_Lebrun_desc: "Albert Lebrun emerged from the chaos of the Third French Republic as a man of balance.\n\nThe French financial and economic situation had never been worse, resulting in unaffordable strikes and civil defiance among the French people during and immediately after the Great War. Within the Third Republic's fractured and fragile internal politics, a clear division had begun to form amid the turbulence.\n\nThe Radical Socialist party tightened its iron grip on the Republic, while the Bloc Nationals hoped to establish their control, while other factions such as the Anarchists and Monarchists carved out their own spheres of influence. In such a volatile political environment, any attempt to unite the various parties under one man could spark a civil war.\n\nLebrun's rise to power was based on his ability to keep the delicate French status quo intact. His election as a moderate conservative was largely a compromise to France's various factions, and his centrist political stance allowed him to appease members of both the Left and the Right. In France, he is acting as both a mediator and a symbol of unity.\n\nBut, as the French political parties begin to drift apart again, and an inevitable conflict looms on Europe's horizon, Lebrun is faced with a dilemma. Can Lebrun truly mend the Republic's schisms, or will France descend into another revolution?"

 # Germany
 GER_Adolf_Hitler_desc: "‘Sic Parvis Magna.’ Do you understand what it means? It's Latin for ‘Greatness from humble beginnings.’ It means that anyone, even at the bottom of the social ladder, can achieve anything they set their minds to. One such man is Adolf Hitler.\n\nHitler was a nobody before Hindenburg appointed him to one of the highest positions in the country. He was a small-time failed artist in Vienna who was rejected from every art school in Austria, which they attributed to his ‘lack of artistic expression’ and seeing his works as nothing more than ‘detailed architect concepts.’ This was regardless of the fact that his education was abysmal, and his father frequently used corporal punishment to punish him for his failures. However, opportunities arise in times of crisis, and opportunities did arise.\n\nWhile selling art on the streets, Hitler would often observe from a distance anti-Semitic groups giving speeches in Vienna, analysing their rhetoric and ingenious use of language and speech to captivate an audience, as well as adapting their philosophies to please the crowds.\n\nWhen the Weltkrieg began, Hitler travelled to Germany and enlisted as a Heer soldier. There, he made internal connections, and after the war, he found his ideal opportunity: the chance to convert shame into anger and defeatism into nationalism.\n\nYear after year, he consolidated his power within the collapsing Weimar Republic, establishing connections from all political parties, from Junkers to military officers to ordinary citizens.\n\nOne of these connections was Hindenburg, who was backed into a corner and reluctantly appointed Hitler to combat the rising tide of Leftism. Hindenburg, unlike Hitler, is a diminished, frail man. His days are numbered, and when Hindenburg dies, Hitler will be in complete control.\n\nThe question is, what does Germany's future hold?"
 GER_Wilhelm_II_desc: "One rarely gets a second chance to govern a country, especially if the first attempt fails. Second chances are extremely rare when one fails on such a grand scale as Wilhelm II did, but that is exactly what he has received. One more chance.\n\nPrior to the war, the Kaiser pursued massive naval expansion plans in an attempt to build a navy capable of competing with the British Royal Navy, while also strengthening the army and rapidly growing the German economy, eventually making it the strongest in continental Europe. Despite these advancements, Germany lost the war. As a result, Wilhelm abdicated both the Imperial and Prussian crowns and was exiled to the Netherlands, where he planned to spend the rest of his life. He, however, did not.\n\nThe turmoil that followed the war's end in Germany was devastating, and the problems that the new federal republic faced were too much to bear. It was then disbanded and replaced by a government run by people who only served to drag Germany further down the wrong path. Many army officers were dissatisfied with the government and decided to take drastic measures. This resulted in Wilhelm's return, who was chosen over his son, the Crown Prince.\n\nCurrently, the old Kaiser is nothing more than a puppet controlled by the military. If he is to make the most of this second chance and use his vast experience, he must establish his authority as Germany's rightful ruler and restore Prussian constitutionalism. However, if he cannot control the army, he will be nothing more than a powerless figurehead..."
 GER_Wilhelm_III_desc: "It is often said that a man pays for his father's sins, and there is no better example of this than young Wilhelm, former Crown Prince of Prussia and now Kaiser of the German Empire.\n\nHis father used his son's birth to spite his British relatives, refusing to use a British physician to ensure a safe birth after one had failed for the old Wilhelm. Instead, he asked his aunt Helena to ensure a safe birth, which occurred on May 6th, 1882.\n\nIn his early years, the Prince lived the Prussian Military Noble way of life, attending a military academy and joining the army, just like his father. Wilhelm had been active in pushing German expansion prior to the Great War, and he hoped to play a leading role in the war's outbreak. Despite his age of thirty-two and having never commanded a unit larger than a regiment, the Crown Prince of Prussia was appointed commander of the 5th Army in August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the Weltkrieg.\n\nHis father's incompetence resulted in the usurpation of power from the monarchy to the Weimar Republic, forcing the monarchy to abdicate, but Wilhelm was undeterred, returning to Germany in 1923 with the intention of returning to politics. Wilhelm's support for the DNVP and military factions ensured that when the failed Republic was overthrown, he was immediately restored to the throne to lead Germany as his father had once done.\n\nYoung Wilhelm can finally right his father's wrongs, restoring Germany to its rightful place in the sun.\n\nFür Kaiser, Gott und Vaterland!"
 GER_Paul_von_Hindenburg_desc: "Nostalgia is a powerful emotion. It drives humans to go to any length to restore the glorious past of old in the present age. Regardless of how powerful it is, it can also drive a man to his demise.\n\nEnter Paul von Hindenburg, a decorated officer in the German Army who wished to establish the Reich as an equal, if not superior, to the empires of Britain and France. He wished for the Kaiserreich's power to be unquestioned and unbowed, for it to become the world's hegemon under the tutelage of the Prussian Eagle. Despite everything he did, including jeopardising his prestige and power within the Reich, he was unable to secure the Reich's ‘Place in the Sun’ that the Kaiser desired and was eventually removed from the pedestals of power.\n\nFate had other plans for Hindenburg, and despite adamant opposition and his tarnished reputation, he has been given another chance to rule Germany as Reichsprasident. Mimicking authoritarian rule during WWII, he passed legislation on the spur of the moment, dissolved the Reichstag whenever he pleased, and appointed whoever he pleased as Reichskanzler. For a brief moment, it appeared that Hindenburg had a chance to restore order in the tumultuous Republic and complete what he had begun so long ago.\n\nHowever, no man can escape the cold grip of death, and his window was closing. He became more senile and forgetful by the day, traits that are not associated with leadership. He needed to act quickly before his luck ran out. He could have delegated power to the SPD, but the SPD had been at odds with Hindenburg since his days as a Prussian officer. He could have delegated power to other parties, but they lacked the necessary seats. When Hindenburg was cornered, he had no choice but to give power to the NSDAP, the one party he was willing to empower despite his bitter relationship with their leader, Adolph Hitler.\n\nHistory will decide whether Hindenburg made the correct decision..."
 GER_Erwin_Rommel_desc: "A soldier who dedicates his life to his country is often rewarded with many things - welfare, lifestyle, and respect - but soldiers are rarely rewarded with the control of an entire nation.\n\nThat is, until the Desert Fox obtained one for himself.\n\nErwin Rommel was no ordinary Reich soldier; he served the Kaiser, the Republic, and now the Führer. Every time he took the lead, he produced positive results quickly. Poland, France, and Africa all faced the Desert Fox's might and terror, succumbing one by one to his supreme strategies. Even the American Army could not withstand Erwin Rommel's Forces' tactical and strategic superiority once the Panzers began landing on the streets of New York and Washington.\n\nThe dust has settled, and America is now officially under the Reich's control. It was assumed that Rommel would complete his duties in North America and return to Germany, but the Führer had other plans. The Führer charged Rommel with the most important task of all: controlling America and firmly establishing the Reich's rule over it. As an added bonus, the Führer bestowed upon Rommel the highest rank possible in his lifetime: Reichsmarschall.\n\nRommel, with the Führer's unwavering support, will do whatever it takes to bring America under the Reich's control. The task is difficult seeing as America is a vast region founded on rebellion and liberty, and it intends to rebel against the Reich through any means necessary. When all is said and done, the German flag will be the only one flying among the Rust Belt rubble.\n\nEmpires rise and fall, but America's Empire was swept away before it even began..."
 GER_Ernst_Rohm_desc: "Ernst Röhm, a violent, aggressive, and cruel man, has been through a great deal. Adolf Hitler's onetime close friend, Röhm, led the Sturmabteilung until he became disillusioned with his old friend and his decisions. Röhm then deposed Hitler and is currently in charge of a new Germany.\n\nRöhm had a successful military career earlier in his life, earning a medal for his service during World War I. He was a frontline soldier before being injured and forced to become an officer. Five years after the war, Röhm retired from the army and joined the NSDAP.\n\nLater, Röhm became dissatisfied with the party leaders' refusal to accept his proposals for a legal alternative to the SA, which was outlawed. Röhm then resigned, left Germany, and joined the Bolivian army as an advisor. However, the ban was lifted a few years later. At Hitler's request, Röhm returned to lead the Sturmabteilung and put his radical ideas into action.\n\nAfter Hitler took complete control of Germany and the SA suppressed all opposition, Röhm and much of his militia advocated for a ‘Second’ revolution that would benefit the working class and fight capitalism.\n\nThis Second Revolution has come to pass. Hitler and his cronies have been deposed, and the streets are now ruled by the Sturmabteilung. But Röhm's regime is frail, and in order for it to survive, he must legitimise it in the eyes of the people and empower his most powerful tool, the SA."
 GER_Gregor_Strasser_desc: "Many different men have been described as the bourgeoisie's bane. The world is divided on what the true revolution is, from men of steel in the East to men of words in the West. Gregor Strasser was born in Germany, the true heart of Europe, a man who broke the false dichotomy, rejected the social left degeneracy, and brought about the German Workers' Liberation.\n\nGregor Strasser was born in 1892, the elder of the Strasser boys, his brother, Otto, and himself. He had a typical middle-class German upbringing, attending school, getting good grades, and eventually becoming an apprentice pharmacist in the Bavarian village of Frontenhausen. During the Great War, he attended officer training, joined an artillery regiment, and eventually rose to the rank of Oberleutnant, earning an Iron Cross for his valour.\n\nFollowing the war, he joined the Freikorps alongside his brother and Heinrich Himmler, and took part in the failed 1920 Kapp Putsch, which Otto had switched sides from and opposed - having joined the left-wing. Both Strasser brothers eventually agreed on politics, joining the NSDAP and turning it into a fervently anti-capitalist cause. Over the next decade, the Strasser brothers kept the flame of the Revolution burning in the face of reactionary forces within the party led by Hitler himself, through the party's fall in 1923 and rise again in 1925, and all the way to the present."
 GER_Kurt_von_Schleicher_desc: "Kurt von Schleicher has been involved in Weimar politics since the German revolution near the end of WWI. He has held numerous appointments and has been involved in numerous Reichswehr activities, including the infamous ‘Black Reichswehr,’ as well as acting as a liaison between the government and the military.\n\nHe has proven to be a savvy politician with lofty goals for himself and Germany. In 1930, he played a key role in deposing Hermann Müller's government and appointing Heinrich Brüning as Chancellor. In his capacity as head of the ‘Ministeramt,’ he even enlisted the Nazi Party's Sturmabteilung as an auxiliary force for the Reichswehr beginning in 1931. From 1932 to 1933, he was the Minister of Defense in Franz von Papen's cabinet and was the driving force behind the ‘Preußenschlag.’ After deft political maneuvering, he orchestrated Papen's demise and succeeded him as Chancellor.\n\nNow, Schleicher must deal with an increasingly divided political arena, with extremists from all sides of the political spectrum threatening his regime and the government's stability. He must navigate and chart a course through this geopolitical storm for a prosperous German future."

 # Italy
 ITA_Benito_Mussolini_desc: "A country in shambles, its people enraged, its economy in decline, and so much blood spilled for so little gain. This was Italy after World War I. People looked everywhere for a change, for someone who could channel their rage toward those who had betrayed them and restore their country's greatness and prosperity. They were looking for a true Italian saviour.\n\nOut of the political chaos that ensued, one man emerged, offering the Italian people their dreams - an Italy that could compete with the biggest and best nations - a land complete with the rightful territory it earned in the Great War but was not given. This was Benito Mussolini, the Iron Prefect who would soon become ‘Il Duce.’\n\nMussolini, a former socialist, became an ardent nationalist after being rejected by the Socialist Party and serving in the Royal Italian Army. Beyond that, however, something defined him - his talk of a national ‘spirit,’ his talk of rejecting falsehoods imposed by the modern world - all of this was seen and heard by a nation thirsting for vengeance, leading to the March on Rome in 1922 and a brutal consolidation of power over the following years.\n\nItaly is at a crossroads, with the new Fascist system firmly in place and trains running on time. Can Mussolini bring the glory he promised the Italian people to his country, or will his system wither and crumble like the Roman Empire he admires? In any case, Il Duce is bracing for the impending storm, and no one knows what it will bring."
 ITA_Victor_Emmanuel_III_desc: "“To be a king, all you need to know is how to sign your name, read a newspaper and mount a horse.”\n\nThat was the only piece of advice Umberto I, Victor Emmanuel's father, gave before being assassinated at the turn of the century, and it wasn't particularly great advice.\n\nDecades later, ‘Little Saber’ and his reign have seen much - war, economic depression, numerous prime ministers, and the establishment of a fascist dictatorship. Despite his shy and withdrawn nature, the monarch wielded considerable power and influence in many of these matters.\n\nIn the case of the Great War, he personally decided that the Kingdom would join the fight alongside the Entente. Instead of hiding, he went to the front lines in the north, braving the constant bombardments alongside his troops, and earned the moniker ‘Il Re Soldato,’ or ‘The Soldier King.’ However, the British and French exploited the nation's bravery and courage after their victory, leaving Italy with a ‘Vittoria Mutilata,’ a ‘mutilated victory,’ an injustice that has haunted him for many years.\n\nHowever, in the aftermath of the war, Victor Emmanuel became even more involved, resolving one parliamentary crisis after another. This quickly sapped his enthusiasm, and with the people's appetite for fascism growing and civil war looming, the King appointed Benito Mussolini as Prime Minister, hoping to bring order to the chaos.\n\nIt has been many years since Il Duce's ascension, and the King has since taken the backseat in which he has always felt most at ease, letting politicians do the politicking, his silence on the fascist regime's atrocities deafening. Despite this, he continues to enjoy widespread support - though for how much longer is unknown..."

 JAP_Hirohito_desc: "They say that power is void and meaningless in silence. It makes no difference how much power you have physically, legally, or in any other way if you don't use it.\n\nThat is the unfortunate reality of the Showa Emperor, a man whose lineage is divine at its core and whose people regard him as a deity. He has been told what to do his entire life, unable to express an opinion or speak his mind, only to condone and accept the consequences.\n\nHe has faithfully listened to his small council of officers, people who have made a mockery of the Showa, using his divine will to achieve unrivalled power within Nihon. With all of the world's power, wealth, and glory, the Showa remains silent on issues that define his country, only approving them on a whim. As he signs a treaty to disarm and promote peace, he authorises an incursion into Manchuria.\n\nWill the Showa Emperor finally exercise the divine will that his forefathers have been cultivating for centuries, or stay silent forever and let others use him as an opportunity for their own plans?"
 JAP_Saito_Makoto_desc: "Compromise, experience, connections, and good fortune propelled Saito Makoto to the highest levels of Tokyo government.\n\nHe was not the first choice, and he was not supposed to rise to power. Nihon needed a new face after the death of his predecessor, one who could stem the tides of the military while also preserving the civilian government. With the pressure mounting, the Emperor chose to install Makoto to power.\n\nHe was a military man, specifically of the Navy, which served as a great counterbalance to the IJA's emergent influence. He had governing experience, with his time in Chosen demonstrating that he could take action and serve as a unifying Prime Minister capable of preventing the military from taking matters into its own hands. He was the ideal candidate, in the right place and at the right time, thanks to his connections as a privy councillor. Some may argue that he is almost too perfect for a candidate.\n\nThe question is, is he truly the saviour Nihon requires, or does he have a hidden flaw in his reputation..."

 SOV_Joseph_Stalin_desc: "Many things are required for leadership - charisma, will, diplomacy, strategy - and these things are often refined and softened over time, seeing as politics is a gentleman's game in which such crude methods of torture, assassination, or murder have no place in this world. Only a few brave and daring souls, such as Joseph Stalin, would dare to return to such primitive forms of governance.\n\nStalin appeared to be the least likely person to inherit a country like Russia, having been born into a poor but religious family. However, fate moves in mysterious ways, and Stalin stumbled upon a golden opportunity. He was able to obtain a book containing teachings that were diametrically opposed to those taught in his school - revolution and socialism painting each page. Over time, he became increasingly committed to the revolution, even at the expense of his grades and class standing. Stalin didn't care since he considered it to be a means to an end.\n\nAnd it was worth the risk as he finally got his chance to rise through the ranks of the Communist Party, becoming close to Vladimir Lenin. He became the Party's point man for various "illegal" operations, such as robbery and extortion. His extremist and radical approaches were not well received by the Party, as such, they attempted to isolate him; however, isolating him had the opposite effect - it had made him more popular than ever.\n\nHowever, once the dust settled and the revolution was declared a success, the true power struggle began. Lenin never saw Stalin as his successor, but through politicking and strategy, Stalin rose to the top of the food chain, pushing Trotsky to the sidelines. Stalin's rule has been nothing short of brutal; his insistence on rapid industrialization has resulted in misery, with famine rife and bodies abandoned in the streets. Stalin's rule, however, is under threat, with many factions attempting to depose him.\n\n There is only one certainty: Stalin will not be deposed easily. His influence and power make it possible for anyone who opposes him to suffer the most unfortunate of outcomes..."
 SOV_Sergey_Kirov_desc: "Sergei Mironovich Kirov is the prototypical Soviet man. He embodies the qualities that any Soviet should strive for: ‘solider, friend, and loyal supporter of the Revolution.’”\n\nKirov, who was born in Urzhum on March 27th, 1886, was instrumental in the rise of the Petrograd Soviet, the success of the October Revolution, and the civil war that followed. Kirov led Bolshevik forces in Astrakhan during the battles that raged there until 1920.\n\nKirov assumed leadership of the Azerbaijani Communist Party after the civil war in 1921 and quickly developed a devotion to Joseph Stalin. Kirov was given the secretary position of the Leningrad City Committee, more commonly known as a mayorship, in 1926 as a reward for his loyalty. He had remained a devoted supporter of Joseph Stalin, though this devotion could be put to the test if Stalin were to betray his trust.\n\nWill Kirov be able to usher in a new dawn for the common worker, or will he be swept aside into the dustbin of history, never to be mentioned in future textbooks?"

 USA_Franklin_Roosevelt_desc: "The American people have suffered greatly as a result of the Great Depression, and it does not appear that the suffering will end anytime soon. Wages have fallen across the country, workers have been laid off, and homelessness is on the rise.\n\nAttempts by the previous administration to stimulate the economy and restore confidence in the financial system were ineffective and frequently had the opposite effect. This eroded public trust in the government, resulting in an overwhelming vote for the first Democratic President since Woodrow Wilson. That man was Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nBorn in New York and distantly related to former President Theodore Roosevelt, FDR began his political career as a state senator before becoming Assistant Secretary of the Navy. But tragedy struck in 1921 when he was diagnosed with polio. He was paralyzed from the waist down, which kept him out of politics for years.\n\nRoosevelt, on the other hand, would not let his career end there. He fought hard to make a comeback and was eventually successful when he became Governor of New York, a position he held until his current position as Commander in Chief of the United States of America.\n\nAs President, Roosevelt will attempt to revitalize the American economy and begin to pull the country out of the Great Depression by enacting a series of programs known as the ‘New Deal.’ Nobody knows if it will work, but he has brought something new to American politics and hope to the American people..."
 USA_John_Nance_Garner_desc: "Vice President John Nance Garner has always rubbed some individuals the wrong way, viewed as both a popular figure in some circles and a ‘evil old man’ in others. His likability, however, was not on the minds of the people at the inauguration, but rather how he planned to help the country get back on its feet and recover from the four-year-long economic crisis.\n\nGarner, who is originally from Texas, studied law before entering politics as a county judge. He only stayed for a short time before being elected to the Texas House of Representatives. During his two terms, he earned the nickname ‘Cactus Jack’ for his unwavering support of the prickly pear cactus when the legislature decided on a state flower.\n\nGarner entered national politics after being elected to the newly created 15th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. He served fifteen consecutive terms in the House, rising through the ranks to become Minority Leader and, soon after, Speaker of the House. Since Prohibition was in effect, he ran a ‘Board of Education,’ where his colleagues could drink alcohol and ‘strike a blow for liberty.’\n\nDespite his lifetime of experience, ‘Cactus Jack’ is unlikely to have the opportunity to influence the President's liberal thinking. However, he will almost certainly be tasked with the difficult task of ensuring that the ‘New Deal’ promised to the American people becomes a reality. This will not be a simple task..."
 USA_Alf_Landon_desc: "Alf Landon, a millionaire businessman and Kansas governor born in Pennsylvania in 1877, perfectly embodies the Rockefeller Republican.\n\nLandon moved from Ohio to attend the University of Kansas. He had hoped to become a banker, but instead found himself invested as an independent producer in the booming local oil industry. When the United States entered the Great War in 1918, Landon enlisted in the Army, rising to the rank of captain in the Chemical Corps but never seeing action in the trenches. He returned to Kansas after being discharged, where his work in the oil industry would make him a millionaire.\n\nLandon was a vocal supporter of Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive Party in Kansas, serving as the governor's private secretary before taking over as governor himself in 1932. Landon emerged as a liberal Republican leader after his re-election two years later, as one of only two Republican governors to survive that year's Democratic landslide. Landon would soon become the Republican nominee for the 1936 presidential election.\n\nLandon supported many aspects of the ‘New Deal,’ but he criticized many areas of inefficiency and perceived hostility toward businesses. Voters appeared to share his concerns, as they voted FDR out and Landon into office."

In 1928, he reached the pinnacle of his long career, becoming Vice President of the United States, partnering with Herbert Hoover in a landslide election victory for a term that is now only a few months away from being over.\n\nCurtis studied and practiced law and then became a prosecutor before being elected to the House of Representatives. Curtis valued personal connections and was an excellent coalition and consensus builder in the Senate, where he went after his stint in the House. He was an excellent Minority Whip and, later, Majority Leader, being called a ‘walking political encyclopedia’ by many of his colleagues.\n\nCurtis ran for President in the 1928 Republican National Convention, but fell far short of establishing a successful anti-Hoover movement after Hoover gained enormous traction following the incumbent President Calvin Coolidge's withdrawal from the race. Curtis' tune quickly changed after the party leaders offered him the vice presidency.\n\nCurtis' exemplary record made him an ideal choice for Vice President, but during Herbert Hoover's administration, Curtis has been relatively inactive, attending cabinet meetings only sporadically. When his term as Vice President ends, he will most likely return to his legal career, which will undoubtedly be lucrative given the connections he has made throughout his political career."

Despite his desire to continue fighting, Hertzog was persuaded to put an end to the bloodshed and restore peace to the Cape.\n\nPrior to entering politics after the war, Hertzog maintained a "South Africa First" stance, wishing for the country to be free of foreign control. When he became Minister of Justice, he maintained his nationalist stance, which frequently caused friction with his colleagues. As a result, he was excluded from the new government formed in 1912.\n\nHertzog, on the other hand, did not give up. Instead, he founded the National Party, which grew in popularity throughout the Great War by opposing the Union government's support for the British.\n\nThis opposition was successful, as Hertzog's National Party formed a coalition government with the Labour Party and took power in the 1924 general election. The National Party won the subsequent election amidst many social and economic improvements for working-class whites. Hertzog's second term saw more social and economic progress for the white minority.\n\nDespite his constant disregard for the coloured majority, Hertzog was elected to a third term as Prime Minister. If he is to win a fourth term, he must navigate these increasingly turbulent times while remaining committed to his policy of promoting South African independence from the British Empire..."
 SAF_DF_Malan_desc: "Daniel François Malan was born on May 22nd, 1874 in Riebeek-West, Cape Colony, and rose to prominence as a South African politician. The Malan surname emerged in South Africa when a French Huguenot refugee named Jacques Malan from Provence (Mérindol) arrived sometime before 1689. D.F. Malan became involved in National Party politics shortly after the party's formation in 1914.\n\nPolitical parties often used daily newspapers to spread their ideals and messages to the public. However, nationalist-minded Afrikaners in the Cape had no such outlet, so in 1915 they decided to release their own daily paper, De Burger, which later became Die Burger, with D.F. Malan as its editor.\n\nHe is truly a charismatic leader unlike any other, and he is also a great world statesman. Our people can only hope that he will lead us to glory and make us the masters of Africa."
 SAF_Jan_Smuts_desc: "The Afrikaner stateman's political career took many twists and turns. From a tenacious soldier fighting the British for Boer independence to a staunch supporter of collaboration with the UK. Despite his opponents' criticism of his authoritarian tendencies, Jan Smuts remains one of South Africa's most influential and powerful men.\n\nSmuts, who was born into a respectable Afrikaner farming family, developed an early interest in literature and philosophy. It therefore came as no surprise that he pursued a legal career abroad, despite some minor financial difficulties. His abrasiveness and seriousness, on the other hand, did not endear him to his peers. He would later become involved in the Boer War against the British, first as a logistics officer and then as a commander of small guerrilla raids. When the writing was on the wall for the Boer cause, he advised that surrendering was the best option to avoid endangering civilian lives.\n\nSmuts fought on in the political arena, determined to protect Afrikaner interests. Needless to say, he had a lot of success in that field, becoming an important player in the negotiations for Afrikaner autonomy and the formation of the Union of South Africa, as well as serving as Prime Minister of the united Afrikaner political party that he helped to create: the South African Party. Smuts solidified his position as a long-time ally and friend of the British crown, fighting in the Great War against colonial German troops and even mediating in the Irish conflict.\n\nRecently, the veteran politician has criticised the Treaty of Versailles and its likely ramifications for Germany and Europe.

 ROM_HoS_Mihai_I_desc: "The young King is now back on the throne, but his ability to reign has waned completely as a result of the dreadful war, his father's incompetence, and the Mareșal's ambitions. Not to say he used to wield political power, but he no longer does. The truth is that, ever since his coronation, Michael has been powerless and a victim of his circumstances.\n\nMichael has been used as a pretty face to look at for those around him for their own gain, much like a ragdoll in the hands of a pouty child, and this has remained unchanged to this day. The king is merely a figurehead to give legitimacy to Antonescu's regime and a figure to rally the people behind, but in the years since the war, that role has declined as the Mareșal's war exploits have spiked his popularity amongst the masses. Still, Michael continued to appear alongside Antonescu at public meetings, national holidays, and other joyous occasions, but every time the young king's role seems to be reduced more and more despite the fact that he’s the de jure holder of the executive power in the country. Every time, he appears to recede further into the shadows, more like a mythical figure than a tangible person.\n\nIndeed, his situation is dire; he is being followed by Antonescu's hounds wherever he goes, and his lack of experience allows a superficial naiveté to show whenever he interacts with public figures, or so he lets on. While Michael is inexperienced, he is still a young man with more than half of his life ahead of him, and sitting in a catatonic state waiting to die would be uncharacteristic of such a lanky young man.\n\nThe great Conducător's eyes can't be everywhere at once, and his leadership isn't appreciated by everyone, so Michael has plenty of opportunities to use his own sharp wits and contacts to potentially better improve the situation in his favour despite the close control in his regard. But he knows he can't do anything right now, so he waits. He waits, but only time will tell if his patience is rewarded."

The freedom to conduct one‟s business ventures without fear of theft or arson? That is what everyone wants in life: to feel safe and secure, safe from the chaos and anarchy that breed terror and fear. Leaders should keep their citizens secure and safe, and they should be someone to look up to for salvation in the face of terror and evil that sweeps the land. Enter Chiang Kai-shek, a man of action who personifies everything citizens desire.\n\nChiang Kai-shek, a military man and one of the Kuomintang's rising powers, believes in the Three Principles of the People, but he understands that this benevolent and ambitious philosophy cannot be realised unless China is stabilised and under the political tutelage of the KMT. He is well aware that no other political organisation, not the Communists and their wretched supporters in the CCP, nor the Japanese and their ‘Xuantong Emperor,’ is capable of realising Sun Zhongshan's vision for China. Only under KMT rule, excluding the Leftist wing, can China truly become what it should be.\n\nChiang, on the other hand, has his own issues to deal with. Many in the KMT, particularly Wang Jingwei and his Left-KMT, believe Chiang is merely a political exploiter who uses crises to his advantage. Not only that, but warlords still rule China, and the Communists and Japanese remain a threat, all of whom want to destroy China for their own reasons.\n\nChiang will either rule China or destroy it. It's as simple as that."

He is bound by strings that bind him to doing whatever he is told to do, or doing nothing at all.\n\nThat is Lin Sen.\n\nLin Sen, like Pinocchio, is a puppet controlled by his master, also known as the Generalissimo.

 TUR_Fevzi_Cakmak_desc: "President Atatürk's death has left a void in the country's leadership. Without him, the prospect of a great, independent Turkey is jeopardised. Strong leadership is required to fill this void, which Ismet Inönü simply cannot provide. Fortunately, the Grand National Assembly recognised this and chose Fevzi akmak, Chief of General Staff, Field Marshal, and Independence War veteran, as the new president.\n\nDespite the change in leadership, political corruption and disloyalty have persisted, and have been exacerbated by Atatürk's death. This will be a significant obstacle for Çakmak to overcome if he is to implement his modified version of the late president's ideas and beliefs, which is based on policies that focus more on developing the currently inadequate military while also emphasising the nationalist elements of Atatürk's vision.\n\nApart from the increased emphasis on the military and nationalism, Çakmak does not share Atatürk's desire to put power in the hands of the people, and will not waste his time attempting to implement a multi-party system for the third time. He intends to reinvest that time in areas that require further development if Turkey is to catch up with the rest of the world.\n\nÇakmak believes he is the right man to lead Turkey into a prosperous future, but as tensions rise across Europe, the smallest misstep could spell disaster for the country, destroying everything that Atatürk built and what he is attempting to build upon."
 TUR_Ismet_Inonu_desc: "The Turkish people are in mourning. President Atatürk's untimely death is devastating, and his vision for a modern, secular Turkey may now be jeopardised. The Grand National Assembly saw only one choice for his successor, former Prime Minister Ismet Inönü, in order to provide an easy transition in leadership and continue progress toward the late president's goals.\n\nIn addition to his new title of president, Inönü has also been given the title of ‘Millî Şef,’ or ‘National Chief,’ as the leader of the Republican People's Party, the country's sole political party. Atatürk attempted to address the lack of a political spectrum, but was unable to do so due to the high level of corruption that Inönü now faces.\n\nAs a result of this corruption, the new president will need time to implement a multi-party system that will last and continue to modernise and democratise Turkey in accordance with Atatürk's vision. This may all be for naught, as tensions rise across Europe and the prospect of a large-scale war approaches; the prospect of escaping the war appears dim due to Turkey's ideal geographical location.\n\Nonetheless, Inönü will try to maintain his resolve. He will go to any length to preserve and protect this country, and he will not jeopardise the future of everything he and Atatürk have built by taking sides in the brewing storm...\n\nWill his bet on neutrality pay off, or will it be the downfall of this fledgling republic?"
 TUR_Mustafa_Kemal_Ataturk_desc: "Mustafa Kemal Atatürk rose to prominence as an Ottoman field marshal during the Great War due to his role in the Ottoman Empire's victory at the Battle of Gallipoli. Following its defeat in the war, the sultanate accepted an armistice and the Treaty of Sèvres, which enabled the empire and even parts of Anatolia to be partitioned.\n\nIn response, the Turkish National Movement, led by Atatürk, was formed. The movement revolted against the treaty, resulting in the War of Independence, the abolition of the Sultanate, the formation of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, and the election of Atatürk as the first President of the Republic.\n\nHe then embarked on a massive reconstruction of the country's political, educational, and cultural systems, with the goal of creating a modern, secular state. To protect the young republic from the destabilising influences of foreign ideologies, Atatürk instituted a one-party system with the intention of making it temporary. However, both attempts to establish a multi-party state failed. Despite this setback, Atatürk continued with his reforms, which included the development of a new Turkish alphabet that was a modified version of its Latin counterpart.\n\nAtatürk has made significant progress in reforming Turkey, but he is facing stiff opposition from greedy and corrupt politicians who reject the need for change. However, if he succeeds in reinventing Turkey, he will be regarded as an outstanding man.\n\nBut the question is, will he be able to do it?"
 TUR_HoG_Mustafa_Ismet_Inonu_desc: "Ismet Inönü has spent much of his life serving his country, first in the Ottoman Empire's army and now as the Republic's first Prime Minister.\n\nAs a soldier in the Ottoman army, he was a gunnery officer who spent his early battles suppressing revolts across the now-defunct empire. During the Great War, he rose to the rank of Colonel, where he met his future president, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, on the frontlines. After being defeated at the Battle of Megiddo, Inönü was sent back to Istanbul and appointed Undersecretary of War, and then General Secretary of Documentation in the Military Council.\n\nInönü joined the Turkish National Movement, where he reunited with Atatürk, shortly after the war's end and the subsequent occupation of Constantinople by Allied forces as part of the treaty signed by the sultanate. Assigned to the Western Front of the Independence War, Inönü led his forces to victory and was appointed Chief Negotiator for the Turkish delegation, squeezing concessions from his counterparts at the negotiating table. This convinced Atatürk to appoint Inönü, his friend and ‘brother,’ as Prime Minister when the Republic was established.\n\nNow, Inönü works tirelessly to combat corrupt politicians and aid in the implementation of Atatürk's vision for a new Turkey, one with a prosperous future free of the flaws of the old Ottoman Empire."

Shawkat worked as an Assistant General Prosecutor in al-Hila until the outbreak of the Great War, when he joined the Ottoman army as a reservist. Shawkat was captured after two years of fighting in the Mesopotamian campaign and joined the Arab Revolt which was led by the Sharif of Mecca, Hussein ibn Ali al-Hashimi.\n\nFollowing Nuri as-Said's resignation in 1932, Faisal I, Hussein's son and King of Iraq, asked Shawkat to accept the position of Prime Minister and lead a non-partisan compromise cabinet free of the factionalism caused by the signing of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and capable of restoring stability to the troubled country.\n\nShawkat is opposed by anti-treaty nationalists such as Rashid Ali Al-Party Gaylani's of National Brotherhood, as well as much of the existing political elite and army factions.

Faisal, however, became disillusioned as the fighting raged on.\n\nHe decided he wanted an empire for himself and engaged in backroom dealings with the Ottoman side, stating that he would defect if given significant territory to rule over — he was denied. This jeopardised the positive, ‘faithful friend’ image he presented to the Entente, so he abandoned his pragmatic scheming.\n\nFaisal's desire for territory was satisfied after the Great War when he was appointed King of Syria. This did not last long, as he was expelled from the country following defeat in the Franco-Syrian War — a minor setback, as he was soon installed as the king of British-mandated Iraq. Maintaining positive relations with Britain while pursuing his pan-Arab agenda was not easy, but he eventually gained the country's independence through his pragmatic nature and ability to negotiate effectively.\n\nWith Iraq set free, Faisal I is closer than ever to realising his pan-Arab dream, though he must remain patient because there is still a long way to go and one wrong move could destroy everything he's worked for..."

He opted for the former, and thus led the opposition to both the dictatorship and the monarchy. This path proved him to be a man of conviction and will, with neither prison nor persecution deterring him.\n\nWhen Alfonso XIII abdicated, Alcalá-Zamora rushed to Madrid, occupied the ministries by force, and established the provisional government.

Primo de Rivera's dictatorship only served to embolden and solidify his ideological position.\n\nHe began his first projects in 1931, as a believer in the necessity of deep reforms, acting as a magnet between socialists, republicans, and the bourgeoisie. Faced with ever-increasing problems and a looming civil war that could lead to the demise of his beloved republic, Manuel Azaña's legacy is one of a man embracing modern visions of his times and one of the few believers in the functioning of a democratic, equal, and solid republic."

So is Spain's everlasting misery throughout its hundreds of years of turbulent history, which now rests in the hands of newly appointed President Manuel Azaña.\n\nAzaña is a controversial figure among his people. To some, he is the sole defender of Spain's chance to join the modern world as a beacon of republican ideals in this age of totalitarianism, while to others, he is the Bolshevik destroyer of culture.\n\nNeither description adequately describes the rather unassuming idealist who, in the midst of Europe's Great War, cultivated his ideals for a new Spain based on the etiquette of the French Enlightenment. More than any other prominent republicans, he was responsible for deposing Primo de Rivera and King Alfonso XIII's dictatorship in 1930, and he could be considered the figurative ‘father’ of the experiment that was the Second Spanish Republic.\n\nAfter only five years, it has ripped itself apart in front of his eyes. Spain is engulfed in civil war, and the responsibility for preserving this creation has been placed squarely in the hands of its creator. Only time and circumstance will determine El Presidente's course of action in this most dire of circumstances, whether to rise above or capitulate to this situation he has created..."
