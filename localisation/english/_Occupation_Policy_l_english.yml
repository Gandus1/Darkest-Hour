 Occupation_GER_DEN.1.t: "German Occupation of Denmark"
 Occupation_GER_DEN.1.d: "The German Army arrived in Copenhagen a few days ago. The invasion, which took place at the end of the night, was one of the fastest ever launched. German tank battalions, known for their amazing tactics, had crossed the country at breakneck pace, entering the capital only two hours after the start of the invasion.\n\nFearing for their lives, King Christian X and his family escaped to the United Kingdom, followed by a few faithful ministers, joining the ever-growing collection of Churchill's royal families in exile.\n\nDespite the failure to capture the King, German troops now control the entirety of Denmark, and since the Fuhrer has not yet spoken in favour of establishing a "Reichskommissariat Denmark," the emergence of many collaborators in the capital should aid the occupation forces.\n\nNotably, politician Erik Scavenius has volunteered to work with a German delegation to resolve the terms of Denmark's capitulation. Recognizing this prompt offer, the German Foreign Minister has dispatched the young Werner Brest to assume political leadership of the crisis on behalf of the Reichstag."
 Occupation_GER_DEN.1.A: "This should do the trick… for now"

 Occupation_GER_NOR: "German Occupation of Norway"
 Occupation_GER_NOR_desc: ""
 Occupation_GER_NOR.1.t: "German Occupation of Norway"
 Occupation_GER_NOR.1.d: "Following the recent invasion of Norway and the surrender of its key cities, most notably Oslo and Bergen, King Haakon VII departed the nation, accompanied by his family and a portion of his government, in an attempt to join the other exiled sovereigns in London.\n\nThe Norwegian Army has been completely disorganised since invading the country for its riches and strategic value. While this is excellent, there are still a few Norwegian units that must be swept up.\n\nDespite the fact that the country is not completely under German control, the Fuhrer directed the occupying forces to establish a new "dominion" here: the Reichkomissariat Norwegen. The administration, led by collaborationist Vidkun Quisling, rapidly began to cooperate with us, providing arms and captives to Wehrmacht soldiers.\n\nFor the time being, the Allies have not yet responded to Quisling's coup or the Reichskommissariat announcement, but it is almost inevitable that they will declare war on the new administration as soon as possible in order to defend the exiled Norwegen government and its supporters."
 Occupation_GER_NOR.1.A: "Who will win, in the end, the King or the Minister-President?"
 Occupation_GER_NOR.1.B: "The entire Norwegian lands will belong to the Reich!"

 Occupation_GER_HOL: "German Occupation of the Netherlands"
 Occupation_GER_HOL_desc: ""
 Occupation_GER_HOL.1.t: "German Occupation of the Netherlands"
 Occupation_GER_HOL.1.d: "As the Reich expands, it has become necessary to form local civilian governments in conquered territories in order to ensure peace and stability. One such administration is the Reichskommissariat Niederlande, the civilian government for occupied Dutch territories.\n\nThe Dutch have long been regarded to be closely related to us. Their culture and history are intricately linked to the Reich's, and many of their customs originate in German origins. As a result, the Dutch have been decided to be treated with dignity and brotherhood.\n\nDirect absorption of these regions into the Reich, however, will be extremely difficult in these times of war. Even if we ignore Dutch opposition, the expenses of integration would be larger than we can currently afford. As a result, rather than imposing a harsh military dictatorship aimed to crush opposition, the decision was made to placate the Dutch people and win them over to the National Socialist way of thought through peaceful management.\n\nThis civilian government is poised to take control of the region, and its presence is likely to boost Dutch cooperation with our rule. Above all, it is expected to prepare the Dutch for direct absorption into the Reich and to pave the path for the Germanization of the region."
 Occupation_GER_HOL.1.A: "This will be enough for now."
 Occupation_GER_HOL.1.B: "The entire Dutch lands will belong to the Reich!"
 
 Occupation_GER_BEL: "German Occupation of the Belgium"
 Occupation_GER_BEL_desc: ""
 Occupation_GER_BEL.1.t: "German Occupation of the Belgium"
 Occupation_GER_BEL.1.d: "With the invasion of Belgium, the time has come to establish a military government in order to adequately control the local populace and maintain the region firmly under Reich control.\n\nBelgium has a long history of animosity toward us. Their foolish strategy of pursuing total neutrality has brought them into direct conflict with us, most notably during World War I. At the end of the war, they even dared to seize the German territory of Eupen-Malmedy. Of course, we have already taken back this region into our direct control.\n\nThe Belgians are more like the Northern French in comparison to us. As a result, it has been established that administering these regions through a single military government would be practical. This will help us to better manage the region's economy while also dramatically lowering labour expenditures.\n\nThe Belgians are unlikely to put up a fight. They do not have a well-organized resistance network, according to our sources. In any scenario, the military administration is expected to thoroughly clean up any signs of non-compliance."
 Occupation_GER_BEL.1.A: "This should deal with the Belgians for now."
 Occupation_GER_BEL.1.B: "The entire Belgian lands will belong to the Reich!"
