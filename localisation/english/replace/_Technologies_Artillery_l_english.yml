 Integrated_Artillery_Guidance_Radar_desc: "Integration of digital computers and more advanced radars allowed artillery batteries to land shots with even greater accuracy, and rapidly calculate enemy artillery positions by tracking incoming fire via radar and quickly calculating conter-battery fire solutions. "
 Laser_Guided_Artillery_Shells: "Laser Guided Artillery Shells"
 Laser_Guided_Artillery_Shells_desc: "The first laser guided projectiles helped hit precision targets in single strikes to disrupt the enemy chain of command and logistics, taking out critical targets in short, quick strikes. "
 Precision_Anti_Tank_Rounds: "Precision Anti Tank Rounds"
 Precision_Anti_Tank_Rounds_desc: "Development of more advanced ATGM munitions and sensors enabled artillery ammunition to strike armor at long distances, without endangering artillery positions in direct-fire combat. Methods such as traditional tube-launched ATGMs, Top-Down cluster munitions, and even smart homing charges designed to navigate and explode above tanks were adopted to fulfill this role."
 Modern_Digital_Fire_Controls: "Modern Digital Fire Controls"
 Modern_Digital_Fire_Controls_desc: "Miniaturization of digital and computer systems allows for the usage of guidance computers, digital calculators and combat control systems to be used by gun crews themselves to carry out a variety of tasks instantaneously; from simultaneous splashdowns to the acquisition of several targets, powerful, small computer equipment allows crews to carry out such attacks on the fly. "
 Prototype_GPS_Guided_Munitions: "Prototype GPS Guided Munitions"
 Prototype_GPS_Guided_Munitions_desc: "Although still prohibitively expensive, the fitting of GPS sensors in warheads along with guidance fins allows for individual shells to destroy high-value targets without the need for spotters or lasers, further threatening the enemy's control and supply points to influence the course of battle on an operational level."
 Precision_GPS_Strike_Munitions: "Precision GPS Guided Munitions"
 Precision_GPS_Strike_Munitions_desc: "The further development of GPS technology allows for cheaper, more availible GPS guided munitions to use against not only operational targets, but against tactical targets as well- answering tactical requests from combat units in a timely manner, taking out strongpoints to turn the tide of firefights."
 Ramjet_Assisted_Projectiles: "Ramjet Assisted Projectiles"
 Ramjet_Assisted_Projectiles_desc: "The development of small ramjets extends the range of artillery further than before, striking targets well out of reach of hostile fire. "
 Fully_Automated_Gun_Systems: "Fully Automated Gun Systems"
 Fully_Automated_Gun_Systems_desc: "Automation and further integration into C3I systems reduces the crew needed- automated ammunition picking and loading systems allows an artillery crew to sit back as the gun system recieves orders, selects the ammunition and firing strategies, and fires / reloads on its own."

 High_Velocity_Armor_Piercing_Rounds: "High Velocity Armor Piercing Rounds"
 High_Velocity_Armor_Piercing_Rounds_desc: "With the fast wear rates of squeeze-bore barrels and the low sectional densities of APCR rounds, a discarding sabot utilizing tungsten can achieve superior penetration at higher velocities."
 Improved_HEAT_Ammunition: "Improved HEAT Ammunition"
 Improved_HEAT_Ammunition_desc: "Developing further on chemical-energy based rounds, increased armor penetration can be achieved without the use of valuable strategic metals."
 Prototype_MCLOS_Missile_Development: "Prototype MCLOS Missile Development"
 Prototype_MCLOS_Missile_Development_desc: "Initial promising tests of guided anti-tank missile systems will open up new possibilities; providing a flexible, lightweight weapon to replace anti-tank guns entirely."
 Gyroscopic_Missile_Stabilization: "Gyroscopic Missile Stabilization"
 Gyroscopic_Missile_Stabilization_desc: "Gyroscopic stabilization and velocity-based control of missiles will vastly improve their hit chances against targets, making flight patterns less erratic and reducing the skill needed to hit with these missiles."
 SACLOS_Missile_Guidance: "SACLOS Missile Guidance"
 SACLOS_Missile_Guidance_desc: "Improved Gyroscopes, as well as semi-automated command controls vastly improves hit rates against targets. By eliminating the need to make manual missile corrections entirely, users only need to track the target with an optical sight"
 Tandem_Charges: "Tandem Charges"
 Tandem_Charges_desc: "The addition of tandem charges defeats the formidable abilities of Explosive Reactive armor, destroying a target's outer layer of armor before striking the armor below."
 Top_Down_Munitions: "Top-Down Munitions"
 Top_Down_Munitions_desc: "With the increasing effectiveness of composite armors and applique armor, it is more efficient to destroy tanks where their armor is the thinnest- the top."
 Passive_Target_Acquisition: "Passive Target Acquisition"
 Passive_Target_Acquisition_desc: "The increased responsiveness of enemy armor puts our infantrymen at risk of being engaged and destroyed when using slow SACLOS systems. Missiles that acquire and track targets on their own will tip the scales again in our favor"
 Multipurpose_ATGM_Munitions: "Multipurpose ATGM Munitions"
 Multipurpose_ATGM_Munitions_desc: "The adoption of various multi-mission rounds allows for ATGM units to also engage non-armor hard targets such as bunkers and tough entrenched positions, making the most use out of their guidance systems"
 Non_Line_of_Sight_and_Semi_Active_Laser_Guidance: "Non-Line of Sight & Semi-Active Laser Guidance"
 Non_Line_of_Sight_and_Semi_Active_Laser_Guidance_desc: "The increasing capability of guidance systems allows missiles to be fired into the air, letting the projectile acquire targets on its own, or via laser guidance"
 Counter_Countermeasures: "Counter-Countermeasures"
 Counter_Countermeasures_desc: "With new emerging countermeasures such as jammers and hard-kill/soft-kill active protection on enemy armor, missiles must evolve ways to counter these systems."
 Extended_Range_Missiles: "Extended Range Missiles"
 Extended_Range_Missiles_desc: "Extending the range of our missiles puts our units beyond the striking distance of the enemy; combined with non-line of sight guidance, our units can essentially become indirect anti-tank artillery"
 Prototype_Hypersonic_KE_Missiles: "Prototype Hypersonic KE Missiles"
 Prototype_Hypersonic_KE_Missiles_desc: "The first working prototypes of hypersonic missiles overcomes the hard limitations of chemical-effect munitions, and threatens to exceed the tracking time of active protection systems entirely"
