###Main battalions
 #anti_tank
 anti_tank_battalion: "Anti-Tank Bn."
 motorized_anti_tank_battalion: "Motorised Anti-Tank Bn."
 motorized_anti_tank_battalion_desc: "Field guns supplied with trucks or gun carriers so they can keep up with mobile forces."
 #anti_air
 anti_air_battalion: "Anti-Air Bn."
 motorized_anti_air_battalion: "Motorised Anti-Air Bn."
 motorized_anti_air_battalion_desc: "Antiaircraft guns supplied with trucks or gun carriers so they can keep up with mobile forces."
 #artillery
 artillery_battalion: "Artillery Bn."
 artillery_battalion_desc: "Howitzers in the range of 100mm-155mm (4in-6in) forms the bulk of modern field artillery. Artillery is intended to support the infantry in the attack by reducing fixed strongpoints, and in the defense by disrupting movement of troops in the open."
 artillery_battalion_light: "Light Artillery Bn."
 artillery_battalion_light_desc: "Light artillery and pack howitzers in the 75mm (3in) size are designed for maximum mobility so they can be moved over rough terrain. Light artillery sacrifices firepower for speed in rough terrain."
 artillery_battalion_heavy: "Heavy Artillery Bn."
 artillery_battalion_heavy_desc: "Siege artillery are the big guns typically larger than 200mm (8in). These guns are heavy, and ill suited for defensive fire support, but are specifically designed to support breakthrough assaults."
 motorized_artillery_battalion: "Motorised Artillery Bn."
 motorized_artillery_battalion_desc: "Standard towed howitzers supplied with trucks or gun carriers so they can keep up with mobile forces."
 rocket_artillery_battalion: "Rocket Artillery Bn."
 rocket_artillery_battalion_desc: ""
 motorized_rocket_artillery_battalion: "Motorised Rocket Artillery Bn."
 motorized_rocket_artillery_battalion_desc: ""
 #cavalry
 cavalry: "Cavalry Bn."
 cavalry_desc: "Cavalry are able to move fairly rapidly over most types of terrain and do not require a supply of fuel to operate, but they are lightly armed when compared with Armoured units, and the automatic weapons of the time can inflict devastating casualties to both men and horses. That is not to say that Cavalry can't prove useful in some instances as a mobile reserve."
 armored_car_battalion: "Armoured Car Bn."
 armored_car_battalion_desc: "Armored cars provide the mobility of horse cavalry but the benefit of some armoured protection. An armored car battalion is not a good substitute for a tank battalion, but is ideal in open terrain to exploit breakthroughs."
 #armor
 heavy_armor: "Heavy Armoured Bn."
 heavy_armor_desc: "The strongest tanks with powerful armor and weapons, but slow and tactically inflexible."
 light_armor: "Armoured Cavalry Bn."
 light_armor_desc: "Armoured units allow real projection of power on the battlefield. Their speed and firepower make them lethal against all but the best entrenched Infantry. However, as tanks become heavier, their speeds will reduce accordingly. They also require a constant supply of fuel to remain in the field and if this vital supply is severed, the armoured unit will be almost useless."
 medium_armor: "Armoured Bn."
 medium_armor_desc: "Armoured units allow real projection of power on the battlefield. Their speed and firepower make them lethal against all but the best entrenched Infantry. However, as tanks became heaver, their speeds would reduce accordingly. They also required a constant supply of fuel to remain in the field, and if this vital supply was severed, the armoured unit would be next to useless."
 super_heavy_armor: "Super-Heavy Armoured Bn."
 super_heavy_armor_desc: "Super Heavy Armor is the ultimate shock weapon. Nearly impossible to kill, they give horrendous bonuses to your units' hard and soft attack values. They also consume enormous amounts of supplies and fuel, and slow your units to a crawl."
 #infantry
 infantry: "Infantry Bn."
 infantry_desc: "Infantry will most likely make up the bulk of your army. They are relatively cheap to build and require no regular fuel supply to manoeuvre, but their lack of motorized transport means their speed of advance is limited. However, Infantry are able to occupy large areas of land, securing ground captured by other forces."
 militia: "Militia Bn."
 militia_desc: "Militia troops lack the training or support weapons of standard infantry. Paramilitary forces generally equipped only with personal weapons can be quickly trained and have limited equipment requirements, but they will always fair poorly against properly trained and equipped Infantry."
 garrison: "Garrison Bn."
 garrison_desc: "Garrisons are second line troops used to safeguard valuable objectives far from the front lines. They lack heavy equipment and transportation, making them immobile except for strategic redeployment. They have limited fighting capability but can be used to free more capable troops for frontline use."
 light_infantry: "Light Infantry Bn."
 light_infantry_desc: "Light infantry puts greater priority on maneuverability than regular infantry. These troops carry less heavy support weapons, which makes them weaker in open terrain, but they can move and fight much better in rough terrain."
 shock_infantry: "Shock Infantry Bn."
 shock_infantry_desc: "These units emphasize firepower over any other considerations. They need more supplies and are more slowed by difficult terrain, but these units are equipped for assaults against prepared defenses."
 mountaineers: "Mountaineers Bn."
 mountaineers_desc: "These troops have been specifically trained for operations in mountainous terrain. They make use of specialised equipment and tactics to give them an edge over regular Infantry in such an environment."
 bicycle_battalion: "Bicycle Bn."
 bicycle_battalion_desc: "Bicycles allow for quicker movement than foot soldiers, without the logistical requirements of the horse cavalry. The downside is that they can't carry some of the heavy support weapons of the horse cavalry."
 marine: "Marines Bn."
 marine_desc: "Marines are an elite branch of the Infantry, specifically trained for assaulting beaches and other naval operations. They make use of specialised equipment and tactics to give them an edge over regular Infantry in such an environment."
 paratrooper: "Airborne Infantry Bn."
 paratrooper_desc: "Paratroopers are an elite branch of the Infantry, specifically trained to either parachute to the ground or be ferried to a battle in gliders. Their rapid deployment capability makes them ideal for use as a mobile reserve or for use in capturing a strategic asset behind enemy lines. However, they are handicapped by a lack of heavy equipment due to their mode of travel, and when they are in action it is advisable to move other units to their support."
 motorized: "Motorised Infantry Bn."
 motorized_desc: "Motorized Infantry make use of wheeled vehicles, such as trucks, to manoeuvre more rapidly than basic Infantry. But they are limited to roads and so their performance may suffer in provinces with poor terrain"
 mechanized: "Mechanised Infantry Bn."
 mechanized_desc: "Mechanized Infantry are equipped with all-terrain vehicles, such as the halftrack, which does not limit them to roads as with Motorized Infantry and allows them to work well with armoured units. However, the specialist equipment they require means their cost is high."
 heavy_mechanized: "Heavy Mechanised Infantry Bn."
 heavy_mechanized_desc: "Mechanized Infantry are equipped with all-terrain vehicles, such as the halftrack, which does not limit them to roads as with Motorized Infantry and allows them to work well with armoured units. However, the specialist equipment they require means their cost is high."
 air_assault: "Air Assault Bn."
 air_assault_desc: "Air assault is the movement of ground-based military forces by vertical take-off and landing aircraft—such as the helicopter—to seize and hold key terrain which has not been fully secured, and to directly engage enemy forces.In addition to regular infantry training, air-assault units usually receive training in rappelling and air transportation, and their equipment is sometimes designed or field-modified to allow better transportation within aircraft."
 fake_intel_unit: "Phantom Bn."
 fake_intel_unit_desc: "Made up of empty tents, inflatable vehicles and a handful of troops sending out fictive radio traffic. These units can fool enemy intelligence but they won't even slow down enemy troops."
